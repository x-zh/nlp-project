Students who are approved to defer their enrollment and who satisfy the requirements listed below do not have to file a new application and are guaranteed re-admission for the subsequent fall semester. Deferred students pay a tuition deposit for the original term of entry, which will be credited to the new term of entry. Deferred students are then considered "Early Decision" admitted students for the new term of entry. They are expected to re-confirm their intention to enroll when our new Early Decision students are expected to do so in January and are held to the same expectations as our other Early Decision students. In essence, students who are approved to defer their enrollment are committed to enrolling at NYU but are simply making that commitment a year in advance. A new admit packet of materials, including a new offer of admission and Candidate Reply Form, will be mailed in December to students who have been approved to defer their enrollment. All students who have deferred their enrollment must confirm their intention to enroll for the subsequent fall by signing and returning the Candidate Reply Form by the deadline indicated in the new offer of admission. A new deposit will not be required. A new offer of admission will not be issued if a final high school transcript has not been received. Students who have been approved for deferred enrollment should understand the following: Students who are approved to defer their enrollment will be offered a space in one our NYU residence halls for the new term of entry. Housing is guaranteed for all of our freshmen who meet our deadlines and requirements. Though approval to defer one's enrollment is typically granted for one year, we do, on occasion, approve students to defer their enrollment for 2 or 3 years. Only students who need to complete compulsory military service or missionary work will be considered for this exception. Students will not be approved to defer their enrollment for 2 or 3 years in advance, and as a result, the second or third year of deferred enrollment must be requested and approved during January of the following year.

This goal is achieved by offering the dental student an integrated endodontic experience in didactics, laboratory exercises and patient care with an emphasis on differential diagnosis, emergency care and interdisciplinary treatment. Diagnosis of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component) Endodontics is introduced as part of a multi-disciplinary course.  The course enables the student to record the 						patient's chief complaint, medical and dental history, as well as extra-and intraoral examination and pulp and 						periapical tissue evaluation.  The student will be able to differentiate pathosis of odontogenic and nonodontogenic 						origin.  An essential goal of this course is to present material that allows students to learn the methods for 						establishing an accurate pulpal and periapical clinical diagnosis. Management of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component) This course component introduces the student to nonsurgical and surgical endodontic treatment modalities.  The 						biological rationale of endodontic treatment is presented.  The use of basic and new methods of instrumentation are 						introduced. Complex Restoration I (Endodontic Preclinical Laboratory Technique Component) A series of laboratory technique sessions introduce the dental student to the fundamental procedures involved in root 						canal access, instrumentation and obturation.  Each laboratory session is preceded by an instructional lecture 						covering the goals and objectives for each exercise.  Basic and advanced instruments and techniques involving hand 						and rotary root canal preparation are included in course exercises. Advanced Endodontics This course, for third-year dental students, consists of a series of lectures on advanced endodontic topics.  The 						information presented enables the student to examine, diagnosis and appropriately treat pulpal and periapical disease. 						Students are also taught to evaluate and treat endodontic emergencies.The evaluation of outcomes in terms of 						prognosis, possible complications and the restorative phase of treatment is stressed. Endodontic Clinic This course provides the third-year dental student with the opportunity to treat patients who require endodontic care 						under faculty supervision.  Correlations between endodontic biology and fundamental and current treatment modalities 						are emphasized. Endodontic Clinic This course provides the fourth-year dental student the opportunity to treat patients who have more complex endodontic 						needs, including selected molars. Interdisciplinary concerns are also a component of treatment planning these cases. Honors in Endodontics This course is offered to a small group of highly motivated students with a high level of academic achievement who are 						particulary interested in endodontics.  This course presents a series of lectures and seminars on advanced and current 						endodontic topics that incorporate the biology of endodontic disease and the comprehensive clinical management of 						complex endodontic cases. > Advanced Education Program in Endodontics > International Program in EndodonticsBiomaterials & BiomimeticsBasic Science & Craniofacial BiologyChair: Nicola C.

A fundamental component of the Department's mission is to provide excellence in teaching across the broad array of academic disciplines at the predoctoral, postdoctoral, and graduate school levels. Departmental teaching for the DDS curriculum focuses on foundational knowledge and practical application to the practice of dentistry for the following subjects: epidemiology, health promotion, bioethics, biostatistics, skills in assessing the professional literature, and public health issues and policy for the dental practitioner. Teaching at the Master's level provides a two-year MS program in Clinical Research , as well as contributions to the Global MPH program offered at the university level. The Department also seeks to partner fully with the NYU Global Institute of Public Health as it builds its educational and research programs in global public health. Most recently at the MS level, the Department led the formation of a new, one-year, full-time MS in Evidence-Based Practice degree program. Moreover, the Department was created and constituted to undertake and achieve major original research and other scholarly activities, and thus to provide national leadership for, and contributions to, the fields of epidemiology and health promotion. The NYU College of Dentistry's DDS curriculum sets the national trend in the teaching of epidemiology and health promotion, with a solid series of foundational didactic and preclinical courses. The four-year curriculum in Skills in Assessing the Professional Literature (SAPL) also sets the national standard for the teaching of EBD. Similarly, the Department's MS in Clinical Research program is a unique offering among US dental schools in that we are the only dental school offering an MS in Clinical Research degree. The recent addition of the MS in Evidence-Based Practice, a one-year full-time program, is the first established in a dental college in the US. The Department also houses the Oral Health Concentration within NYU's MPH in Global Health program, and offers a joint DDS-MPH degree opportunity. The PhD in Epidemiology program, run in collaboration with Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University, is now in its 21st year of operation. The Department has had a major commitment to research and scholarly activities since its inception in June 2000.Over its first 13 years of existence, the Department has received over $55 million in over 20 externally funded grants, most from the NIH, in which Departmental faculty serve as the PI or co-PI of the study. The research portfolio has included: In addition, the Department recently completed four five-year cycles of NIDCR/NIH funding for its NYU Oral Epidemiology T32 NRSA Training Grant, and is now launching a new version of that program, the NYU Global Postdoctoral Oral Epidemiology Training (POETS) program, which will also offer the PhD in epidemiology (again, in collaboration with the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University), but now focused on international applicants. Finally, several Departmental faculty members serve as research mentors for clinical faculty at NYU, both in the College of Dentistry and in the School of Medicine. The Departmental faculty involve themselves in a wide variety of  community and University activities that vary year-by-year.    Departmental faculty run the NYU Spaghetti & Science Society, a  monthly student club that meets in an Italian restaurant in Greenwich  Village to discuss a scientific article over "a plate of pasta and a  glass of wine."  In past activities, a faculty member developed and  taught a six-week earth sciences module on wind energy versus nuclear  energy at the Salk Science School, a NYC magnet science Jr. High School.   Another faculty member has served as the program officer for a NYC  service to bring geriatric dental services to needy New Yorkers, while  another serves on several NYC and New York State health boards. The Department of Epidemiology & Health Promotion was created in  June 2000. During the first 13 years of its existence, the Department  faculty served as PI or co-PI on new grants  totaling more than $55M  from a range of national and state agencies. The Department currently  houses the following graduate degree programs:  the PhD in Epidemiology  program, established in 2000 jointly with Columbia University's  Department of Epidemiology; both the Certificate and the MS in Clinical  Research programs (which began in 2002); and the Oral Health  Concentration for the Global MPH (which began in  2006).Oral & Maxillofacial SurgeryFrequently Asked QuestionsAdmission RequirementsAll students applying to the New York University College of Dentistry must meet the following minimum requirements: * Credits are by semester hour.

The Program exists thanks to the sponsorship of Henry Schein Cares, the global social responsibility program of Henry Schein, Inc. NYUCD's comprehensive global outreach programs offer participants a unique, service-learning experience. These interdisciplinary programs provide faculty, residents and students of dentistry, hygiene, nursing and public health with a well-rounded perspective on access-to-care issues and challenge them to rethink their roles as healthcare providers. Clinical outreach programs provide free dental services to populations facing barriers to oral healthcare including a dearth of dental providers, economic hardship and inadequate health insurance coverage. Students and residents receive hands-on clinical instruction and are exposed to public health issues in dentistry. Post-outreach evaluations have consistently shown a transformational effect on participants, and past participants have noted these experiences as a highlight in their NYUCD student career.

The four main branches are metaphysics (What is the ultimate nature of reality? What really exists and what is mere appearance?); epistemology (What, if anything, can be known and how?); logic (What are the principles of correct reasoning?); and ethics (What is moral value? And what moral values should we adopt?). Other, more specific, branches of philosophy address questions concerning the nature of art, law, medicine, politics, religion, and the sciences. Everyone tends to have or assume answers to these questions. The aim of the department is to enable students to identify, clarify, and assess these answers, both ancient and modern. Philosophy prepares students for a more reflective life, for advanced studies in the subject, as well as for professions that emphasize analytic thinking and argumentation, such as law, business, and programming.Program of Study | Philosophy | NYUNYU Computer Science Department > Graduate Programs in Computer ScienceThe Department of           Computer Science offers courses leading to the MS and           PhD degrees.

The primary           facility for graduate educational and research computing           is a network of several hundred workstations. In           addition, individual research groups have their own           hardware resources including Silicon Graphics           workstations, MacIntoshes, IBMs, DECs and HPs. Access to           the Internet is provided through a T3           connection. Each supported           doctoral student has access to his or her own dedicated           Unix workstation. Many other research machines provide           for abundant access to a variety of computer           architectures, including a distributed computing           laboratory comprising 16 Sparc 5s and 16 Pentium           PCs.NYU Computer Science Department > Requirements for the MS in Computer Science Effective Fall 2009An MS student must complete 36 points of approved coursework satisfying requirements A, B, C, and D, below. A. An MS student must complete 36 points of approved coursework with a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0. - 21 credits must be taken as standard CS  classroom-based courses. - An additional 6 credits must be  either standard classroom-based CS courses;  standard classroom courses in the Math Department; independent study with a full-time faculty supervisor in the Computer Science Department, excluding external internships; or master's thesis. Independent study and master's thesis require DGS approval. - The remaining 9 credits may be any of the above, or may be: credits transferred from previous graduate study in Computer Science at another university; external internship; or relevant graduate courses in other departments at NYU. At most 6 credits of external internship may be taken. Relevant graduate courses and external internship require DGS approval. B. An MS student must complete the three foundational courses, which are G22.1170 Fundamental Algorithms; G22.2110 Programming Languages and G22.2250 Operating Systems, and achieve a B- (2.7) or better rolling GPA in the foundational courses attempted. An MS student will remain in good standing only if he or she achieves a B- (2.7) or better rolling GPA in the foundational courses that have been attempted so far. The rolling GPA is the average GPA of the foundational courses taken so far. If a student does not satisfy this requirement, the student will be placed on probation. The student will have until the end of the following semester to restore himself or herself to good standing or will be terminated from the program. A full-time MSCS student must successfully complete at least one of the three foundational courses within the first three courses taken and must successfully complete all three foundational courses within the first six courses taken. A part-time MSCS student must successfully complete a foundational course as the first course taken and must successfully complete all three foundational courses within the first six courses taken. On rare occasion, an entering MSCS student may be granted an exemption from one or more foundational courses. To obtain such an exemption, a student must meet with the Director of Graduate Studies for the MS programs (DGS) at the beginning of the student's first semester at NYU.  The student requesting an exemption must provide clear documentation showing that his or her previous coursework is the equivalent of the corresponding foundational course and, upon approval of the DGS, must pass a placement test at the start of the first semester. The placement test will be as challenging as the final exam in the corresponding course. C.An MS student must pass one course in two of the following four designated application areas: computation for science and society; graphics; intelligent systems; and databases. Computation for science and society includes courses on numerical  methods and courses on applications of computation to the physical,  biological, and social sciences. Graphics includes courses on computer graphics, visualization, solid  modelling, vision, multimedia, and animation. Intelligent systems includes any course on artificial intelligence,  machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing. Database courses include databases, distributed computing, and data  mining. Some courses can be counted in either of two areas. For example a  student taking Computer Vision can count it either as an AI course or as  a Graphics course (but not both). D. An MS student must complete a designated capstone course with a grade of B (3.0) or better. Alternatively, subject to the requirements below and prior approval of the DGS, the student may complete a master's thesis or advanced lab. Capstone courses will be identified each semester by the DGS. They require substantial programming effort and draw on key technical areas covered by the MS program. Examples of capstone courses include Advanced Computer Graphics, Advanced Database Systems, and Compiler Construction. A capstone course should be taken during the last year of studies. A student may instead choose to write a master's thesis if the following conditions are satisfied: the student has a cumulative GPA of 3.75 after six courses; the student has completed all three foundational courses with at least a B+ in each; the student has found a full-time faculty member to serve as a thesis advisor; and the student has received approval from the DGS. MS thesis work can count for up to six credits of master's coursework. The thesis must satisfy the following criteria: it must be original research or design/implementation; the work required must be equivalent to that of two regular MS courses; the thesis must result in a high-quality document of 30-50 pages or more; and the thesis must be read and approved by two full-time faculty members, one of whom is the advisor. At the discretion of the advisor and the DGS, the thesis may be published on the department web page.NYU Computer Science Department > Master of Science in Information SystemsA Master's Degree Combining Computer Science at Courant and Business at Stern. Given today's ubiquitous computing, organizations have a critical need for people who understand, in depth, both computers and business. The most successful technology leaders, from Bill Gates to Andy Grove to Steve Case, are those with deep expertise in technology and business strategy. Successful new technology products and information systems always combine technical quality and smart business strategy. Developing these systems requires extensive communications among technical developers, business managers and users. The Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) program focuses on training students in the core concepts of computing and business so graduates can develop successful careers in management positions that require deep technical skills. For example, MSIS graduates have excelled in the following careers. MSIS students draw from the same courses as Courant Computer Science graduate students and Stern MBA students. The MSIS program offers the academic equivalent of an abbreviated combined Computer Science Master's and MBA degree. The MSIS degree requires 13 courses (39 credits), 5 Stern courses, 5 Computer Science (CS) courses, an Information Technology Projects course and 2 free electives which may be taken at CS or Stern. The Graduate School of Arts & Science requires that students maintain good standing throughout their studies. This involves sustaining a grade-point average of at least 3.0 (B) each semester, successfully completing at least 66% (2/3) of all courses attempted, and completing the degree within five years. Students falling below the GPA and course completion requirements are placed on probation, and given until the following fall or spring semester to return to good standing, or faced with possible academic dismissal from the program. The following course distribution is required (3 credits per course unless otherwise noted): A total of 13 courses (39 credits) are required. One of the last courses an MSIS student takes is IT Projects . This course is a unique software engineering and project management practicum. IT Projects offer students real world experience understanding and solving IT solutions to business problems via participation in a set of team projects at clients such as local corporations, non-profits and government agencies. Each team of about 4 students undertakes one IT project that lasts a semester. The course offers an opportunity to experience (most of) the complete IT project life cycle. The following steps of an IT project are taught and practiced: The course encourages students to learn to balance 'analysis' and 'implementation' efforts to produce good software efficiently. It teaches students about the wide range of project management methodologies and approaches so they can think about how to choose the correct approach. In some cases, the Projects course has led to students obtaining employment with the clients served by the course. Note: please refer to the full set of instructions and guidelines listed on the Computer Science Department Graduate Admissions page. Candidates apply to the MSIS program through the Computer Science department in the Graduate School of Arts and Science. Applicants must have an undergraduate degree.

Shasha Bud Mishra Mehryar Mohri Computational Biology uses mathematical, statistical and algorithmic techniques to solve problems arising in biological research. The faculty working in this area collaborate with biologists and applied mathematicians on a broad range of problems in genomics, proteomics, molecular modeling, systems biology. The CS Department, along with a number of other departments and schools (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Neuroscience, Sackler Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine) participates in the interdisciplinary Computational Biology Program. Richard Bonenau 's lab develops and implements methods for modeling biological global regulatory circuits that are general and can be applied to many systems. He is one of the leaders in the development and deployment of "Rosetta", a state of the art protein folding program. The primary current research directions include distilling functional information from genome-wide de novo predictions, grouping genes into functionally related and co-regulated clusters, and learning the structure of biological circuits from data. Tamar Schlick 's group works on determining the structural and dynamical properties of macromolecules by computer simulation. Computational techniques are critically needed to link the static structural information on proteins and nucleic acids obtained by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance with the wide range of biological activity and reactivity in the realistic environment of the cell. In this goal, sophisticated models, reliable numerical tools and simulation protocols are critical; the group's research includes all of these aspects of computational molecular modeling. Dennis Shasha 's research interests are focused on three areas: algorithmic and visualization support for computational biology, time series analysis, and tree and graph pattern matching. In computational biology, Dennis Shasha works on tools and algorithms for plant genomics and proteomics research. Time series analysis is needed in many areas ranging from physics to finance to music. Dennis Shasha and collaborators are working on efficient algorithms for performing online windowed correlation analysis on very large time series datasets (thousands or even millions of numbers). Graph pattern matching problems also arise in many areas from XML querying to chemistry; Denis Shasha's group developed a number of algorithms and software tools for various graph matching problems. Dennis Shasha also works on several themes in databases: privacy-protection (when the server cannot be trusted as in out-sourcing cases), database tuning, and testing. Bud Mishra has worked in many areas of Computer Science. His current focus is on applications of computer science and mathematical ideas to biological sciences. He has developed optical mapping technology, a successful approach to physical genome mapping. He aims to develop efficient practical algorithmic tools for genome mapping and sequencing. He leads a number of projects in bioinformatics, primarily in genomics and systems biology, including a novel technology aimed at making fast and cheap sequencing of the human genome broadly accessible, a cancer genome atlas, algebraic model checking for systems biology, large-scale models of pandemic flu and smallpox and many others. Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing.

ProgramsNYU Computer Science Department > CryptographyYevgeniy Dodis Victor Shoup Cryptography research deals with theoretical questions and algorithms necessary for secure communications over untrusted channels. Cryptography researchers work on theoretical foundations and practical algorithms for a variety of communication tasks, including authentication (proving one's identity), confidentiality of messages, data integrity and other. With rapidly spreading use of the internet for many critical tasks, from financial transactions to medicine, reliable cryptographic techniques are increasingly essential for communication. Yevgeniy Dodis is primarily interested in cryptography. His current primary research directions are cryptography based on imperfect randomness, exposure-resilient cryptography, cryptography with biometrics and other noisy data, hash functions and random oracle model and information-theoretic cryptography. Recent achievements include design of special purpose randomness extractors for imperfect sources, formal model of cryptography based on noisy data, design and formalization of intrusion-resilient cryptosystems and new criteria and techniques for design of hash functions. Victor Shoup 's research areas are cryptography and computational number theory; he is especially interested in the interactions between these two areas. He designs and analyzes cryptographic primitives and protocols with security properties that can be proven based on clear and reasonable assumptions, and which are nevertheless practical enough to use in the real world. Most recently, he has been working on practical secure deniable protocols (i.e., participants in an exchange using this protocol can deny that it ever took place) based on novel and use of number-theoretic algorithms.

Yap Denis Zorin Researchers in Computer Graphics work on computational and mathematical techniques for creating and manipulating computer representations of real and virtual objects and making images of such objects. The main directions of computer graphics research at NYU include animation, geometric modeling, physically-based simulation and computational photography. The area of Computer Vision is concerned with algorithms and theory necessary to extract information from visual data (images, video, range scans, stereo images, 3D MRI and CAT scan data etc). There is a growing overlap between computer vision and vision research, as the data acquired from images and video is increasingly used in computer graphics applications. Rob Fergus works in computer vision, machine learning and computer graphics. His goal is to build statistical models of images both at the high level of objects and scenes as well as at the low level of pixels and edges. Such models may then be used for a variety of applications including object recognition, image search and computational photography. Davi Geiger works in computer vision and on related problems in cognitive science. His current research includes understanding stereo vision, human tracking, shape analysis, and memory structure of vision objects. Much of recent is based on applying Bayesian belief propagation networks (graphical models). Yann LeCun 's research interests include the fundamental and practical aspects of machine learning. The main goal of his research is to devise methods through which computers can extract knowledge and automatically acquire "skills" from massive datasets or from experience. Application of learning to perception is a central theme of his work: how can we teach machines to detect and recognize everyday objects in images, how to teach robots to navigate and avoid obstacles solely from visual input. LeCun's group works on a number of fundamental techniques (energy-based models, "deep learning", relational graphical models, and others) which are applied solve problems in computer vision, robotics, image and signal processing, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and economics. LeCun's group also works with the Center for Neural Science on computational models of biological learning. Ken Perlin 's research spans computer graphics rendering, modeling and animation, user interface software and hardware, surface reflectance measurement devices, and novel display devices. His recent research projects include a collaboration with the New York Hall of Science on creating large scale collaborative educational interfaces for kids, uses of novel interfaces (camera-tracked LED pointers and the Nintendo WiiMote game interface) for collaboration and instruction, and a kaleidoscope-based reflectance measuring device for rapid acquisition of surface reflection functions. Chee Yap works in the areas of computational geometry, algebraic computation and visualization. His current research focuses on two themes: exact arithmetic computation and large-scale visualization. Numerical nonrobustness has been called "computer scientists' dirty secret" --everyone knows that our numerical software can break, but we rarely talk about it. The most successful approach to solving the robustness problem in geometry is based on exact geometric computation. Chee Yap and his group are developing techniques for this type of computation based on algebraic zero bounds. Exact geometric computation provides considerable insight into the theory of real computation. The other direction of Chee Yap's work is large-scale visualization, dynamic visualization of geospatial data in particular. Denis Zorin 's interests span two areas: geometric modeling, with applications in computer graphics and computer-aided geometric design, and scientific computing and numerical algorithms. In geometric modeling, he works on efficient and accurate discretizations of various types of surface optimization problems, high-order representations for surfaces, including manifold-based and subdivision surfaces and applications to interactive surface and mesh manipulation. In numeral algorithms, he is interested in fast algorithms for solving boundary integral equations, arising from linear PDEs and their applications. Current efforts include a a general fast multipole-based solver for 3D nonhomogeneous PDEs and arbitrary geometries, and on fluid-deformable surface interactions for Stokes fluid.

Goldberg Thomas Wies The long-term goal of the formal methods group is to increase the reliability of hardware and software systems by providing tools and techniques for the analysis of these systems. In formal analysis, a mathematical model of a system is developed, which can then be used to prove properties of the system or to discover bugs in the system when the proof fails. The activities and interests of the formal methods group cover a broad spectrum, from the study of mathematical foundations in temporal and first-order logic, to the implementation of verification tools such as TLV and CVC3, to the application of these tools for proving the correctness of embedded systems and compilers. Clark Barrett 's interests encompass both the theory and application of formal techniques. Theoretical interests include propositional and first-order logic, model and proof theory, and automated deduction. Professor Barrett is a pioneer in the emerging field of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), in which efficient propositional reasoning is combined with decision procedures for first-order theories to produce solvers that are both automatic and expressive. The flagship tool developed by the group is the SMT solver CVC3, which is used by researchers around the world. Patrick Cousot is the founder of Abstract Interpretation, a theory of sound approximation of mathematical structures, in particular those involved in the behavior of computer systems. It allows the systematic derivation of sound methods and algorithms for approximating undecidable or highly complex problems in various areas of computer science (semantics, verification and proof, model-checking, static analysis, program transformation and optimization, typing, software steganography, etc.). Its main current application is on the safety and security of complex hardware and software computer systems. Benjamin Goldberg works at the interface between programming languages, compilers, and verification. One of the directions of his work is to develop techniques for insuring correct compilation, that is, automatic methods for verifying that a compiler is producing executable code that is a correct translation of the source code. A related effort is the development of techniques for the automatic synthesis of correct executable code from high level requirements specifications, particularly in the area of embedded systems. Tools developed by the Translation Validation project were successfully applied to validate optimizations by widely used industrial compilers. Thomas Wies research interests are in formal methods, verification, and programming languages. In particular, he is interested in the theory and development of tools that increase software productivity and assist software engineers in building reliable software. This includes tools for automated verification, automated error detection, and automated debugging. A central thrust of Professor Wies' research is the development of abstraction techniques for automated reasoning about complex data and control in modern software artifacts, such as heap-allocated data structures and concurrency. Analysis of Computer Systems GroupNYU Computer Science Department > Machine Learning and Knowledge RepresentationErnest Davis Yann LeCun Mehryar Mohri Foster Provost David Sontag Machine learning is concerned with developing of mathematical foundations and algorithm design needed for computers to learn, that is, to adapt their responses based on information extracted from data. For example, learning algorithms may allow a robot to navigate an unknown environment, improving its performance as it acquires more and more data, or a voice-controlled system to improve its recognition of a person's speech after analysis of a sufficient number of samples. Machine learning techniques draw on many fundamental areas from statistics to theoretical computer science, and are used in a broad variety applications: robotics, speech analysis, finance, computer games, handwriting recognition to name just a few. Ernest Davis studies the problem of representing commonsense knowledge: that is, the problem of taking the basic knowledge about the real world that is common to all humans; expressing it in a form that is systematic enough to be used by a computer program; and providing the program with techniques for effectively using that knowledge. The primary focus of his work is on spatial and physical reasoning (for example, a formalization of commonsense physical reasoning must capture our intuition about qualitative object behavior under gravity). Other directions of work include reasoning about knowledge, belief, plans, and goals, and their interaction with physical reasoning. Development of formal representations of this type has many potential applications in robotics, product and process design and automated training. Yann LeCun 's research interests include the fundamental and practical aspects of machine learning. The main goal of his research is to devise methods through which computers can extract knowledge and automatically acquire "skills" from massive datasets or from experience. Application of learning to perception is a central theme of his work: how can we teach machines to detect and recognize everyday objects in images, how to teach robots to navigate and avoid obstacles solely from visual input. LeCun's group works on a number of fundamental techniques (energy-based models, "deep learning", relational graphical models, and others) which are applied solve problems in computer vision, robotics, image and signal processing, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and economics. LeCun's group also works with the Center for Neural Science on computational models of biological learning. Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing. Foster Provost studies data mining, knowledge systems, and machine learning and their alignment with business problems. He has applied advanced technologies to a variety of business problems, including fraud detection and customer contact management. His research directions include robust modeling in the face of imprecision in the business environment, and profiling/monitoring on-line activity. David Sontag's research interests include theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning and probabilistic inference, with applications to medicine, natural language processing, and information retrieval. In particular, he studies structured prediction, approximate inference in graphical models, unsupervised learning of latent variable models, and computational trade-offs between learning and inference. Computational and Biological Learning Lab ML Research Group Machine Learning SeminarNYU Computer Science Department > Natural Language and Speech ProcessingRalph Grishman Satoshi Sekine Adam Meyers Mehryar Mohri Naomi Sager The amount of text which is available in electronic form is growing at an explosive rate. In addition to the web, large quantities of text are being collected for medical, legal, commercial, and scientific applications. But the tools for getting the information we need out of this text are still quite primitive. Our research groups in natural language processing are building systems to to extract specific information from large text collections, and to present it in the user's preferred language. A closely related area, speech processing, deals with coding, synthesis and extraction of information from speech signals. Natural language processing has a long history at NYU. The Linguistic String Project was one of the pioneers in natural language processing research in the United States. The Proteus Project focuses on automatically learning the linguistic knowledge needed for information extraction and machine translation. It has developed extraction systems in English and Japanese, and a series of language-independent translation models. It also conducts a wide range of basic research, and develops large-scale dictionaries and other resources for natural language processing. Ralph Grishman 's area of research is natural language processing, -- automatically 'understanding' natural language. He works on systems for information extraction, which can pull out, from text, information about specific relationships or types of events. For example, one of the systems developed by the group can process the newspaper text and construct a table of new executive hires and fires, or corporate acquisitions. A current focus of Ralph Grishman's group is learning information from large text collections. The group is a part of a major DARPA-funded effort to develop an integrated speech-machine translation-information extraction software lead by SRI international. Satoshi Sekine is working on a variety of topics in natural language processing: on-demand information extraction, knowledge discovery from text corpora, to discover patterns, paraphrases, relations and semantic knowledge question answering and summarization, software for Japanese and English text analysis, Japanese and English named entity tagging. Adam Meyers research interests are in natural language processing and computational linguistics. His main direction of work include computational lexicography, predicate argument structure, sentence alignment, coreference and corpus annotation. Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing. Proteus ProjectNYU Computer Science Department > Networks, Operating and Distributed SystemsRobert Grimm Zvi M. Kedem Jinyang Li Dennis E. Shasha Lakshminarayanan Subramanian Michael Walfish Systems and networking research explores how to structure the basic software running on individual computers and how to coordinate between different computers. Significant challenges include how to support increasing numbers of processors in modern computer systems, leverage the many embedded and mobile computing devices, and build services that scale to a global audience. Robert Grimm is interested in the interaction of programming languages and systems. The focus of his research is on exploring how to leverage programming language technologies for making operating and distributed systems easier to build, extend, and administer. Current efforts include Na Kika, a platform for securely extending web applications and scaling them to a global audience through edge-side hosting, and xtc, a toolkit for making programming languages and their compilers easily extensible. He is using the xtc toolkit to realize the Jeannie language, which combines all of Java and all of C into a new language that eliminates verbose boiler-plate code, enables static error detection across the language boundary, and simplifies dynamic resource management. Zvi Kedem has conducted research in computational complexity (algebraic complexity, VLSI complexity); computer graphics (surface reconstruction, BSP tree algorithm); database, knowledge-based systems, and data mining (concurrency control, relational discrete event systems, pincer-search algorithm); parallel and distributed systems (parallel algorithms, compilation for special-purpose parallel machines, reliable parallel computations on LANs and the WWW). His research focus is algorithmic techniques for designing computer-based systems. Jinyang Li 's research interests are in distributed systems and computer networks, and information retrieval systems. Large-scale distributed systems increasingly rely on grassroot deployments, as demonstrated by the popular peer-to-peer file sharing applications and community wireless mesh networks. It is difficult to ensure robustness and security in such distributed systems since the hundreds of nodes comprising these systems are typically unreliable, selfish and potentially malicious. One of the goals of Jinyang's research is to design and build reliable and secure peer-to-peer systems and wireless networks. Dennis Shasha 's research interests are focused on three areas: algorithmic and visualization support for computational biology, time series analysis, and tree and graph pattern matching. In computational biology, Dennis Shasha works on tools and algorithms for plant genomics and proteomics research. Time series analysis is needed in many areas ranging from physics to finance to music.

Lakshminarayanan Subramanian 's research interests span the areas of networking, distributed systems, security and technologies for developing countries. He is exploring a range of topics including routing protocol design, security issues in routing protocols, quality of service, congestion control, overlay networks and wireless networks. His current focus is on practical security problems in network protocols and distributed systems (enterprise security and byzantine fault tolerant systems) and systems/networking challenges in developing country settings (issues of low cost connectivity solutions for rural villages and how to make distributed systems operate in environments with intermittent power). He is one of the designers of WiLDNet, a lo-cost network deployed in parts of the world from Ghana to Philippines. Michael Walfish 's research interests are in systems, security, and networking. He has worked on untrusted computation, untrusted storage, failure detection in distributed systems, naming, network architecture, verifiable auctions, and denial-of-service defense. Networks and Wide-Area Systems Group eXTensible C Na KikaNYU Computer Science Department > Scientific ComputingMarsha J. Berger Leslie Greengard Michael L. Overton Olof B. Widlund Margaret H. Wright Denis Zorin Scientific Computing has a long tradition at the Courant Institute, which was founded by Richard Courant at the dawn of the computer era. Computers were invented in the late 1940's and early 1950's for exactly one purpose: solving hard scientific and engineering problems which required too much numerical computation to do by hand. Now, virtually all branches of science and engineering rely heavily on computing. The traditional two branches of science are theoretical science and experimental science. Computational science is now often mentioned as a third branch of science, complementing theory and experiment. Many faculty at Courant, both in the Computer Science and Mathematics Departments, have strong interests in Scientific Computing, both in specific application areas and in general techniques and analysis that have broad applicability. Marsha Berger 's areas of research include computational fluid dynamics, adaptive methods for the numerical solution of pdes in complex geometries, and large-scale parallel computing. She developed techniques for automatic grid for complex geometries generation, needed, for example, to compute the flow around a full aircraft in three dimensions. Efficient simulation of complex flows require adaptive algorithms which concentrate the computational effort where it is most needed. Marsha Berger collaborates with NASA scientists; their jointly developed software is widely used for modeling of aerodynamic behavior in aviation and space launch vehicle projects. Leslie Greengard 's research is largely concerned with the development of fast and adaptive algorithms for computational problems in biology, chemistry, materials science, medicine, and physics. He is best-known for having developed the fast multipole method (FMM) with V. Rokhlin; the FMM is widely used in electromagnetics, astrophysics, molecular simulations, and fluid dynamics. He currently works on protein design, the analysis of "metamaterials", diffusion in complex geometry, and reconstruction methods for magnetic resonance imaging. Michael Overton studies numerical algorithms in optimization and linear algebra. One of the primary directions of his work is semidefinite programming, which is linear programming in the space of real symmetric matrices with eigenvalue positivity constraints. Most recently, his research has focused on optimization problems involving eigenvalues and pseudospectra of nonsymmetric matrices, which arise in control applications. Olof Widlund is interested in numerical algorithms for partial differential equations. He has worked extensively in domain decomposition algorithms for the large linear systems of algebraic equations that arise in many computational continuum mechanics problems, for example in fluid dynamics and elasticity. These algorithms are widely used for solving large-scale problems on parallel and distributed computers. Most recently, Olof Widlund's group has focused its work on FETI-DP and BDDC algorithms for elliptic systems, and on domain decomposition methods for electro-magnetics and mortar finite element methods. Margaret Wright's work includes two parts: basic research into theory and algorithms in optimization and linear algebra; and solution of real-world optimization problems in science and engineering. In her work, the interplay between research and practice goes in both directions. Solving practical problems effectively demands application of her technical knowledge and skills; and the experience of working on a practical problem often inspires fundamental research that moves in new and unexpected directions. Denis Zorin 's interests span two areas: geometric modeling, with applications in computer graphics and computer-aided geometric design, and scientific computing and numerical algorithms. In geometric modeling, he works on efficient and accurate discretizations of various types of surface optimization problems, high-order representations for surfaces, including manifold-based and subdivision surfaces and applications to interactive surface and mesh manipulation. In numeral algorithms, he is interested in fast algorithms for solving boundary integral equations, arising from linear PDEs and their applications. Current efforts include a a general fast multipole-based solver for 3D nonhomogeneous PDEs and arbitrary geometries, and on fluid-deformable surface interactions for Stokes fluid.

Our courses are intended for students desiring a strong background in the foundations and uses of computing. Computer science is a practical art that has led to revolutionary innovations in entertainment, the humanities, health, business, the news media, communications, education, scientific research and the arts. It is also a science rooted in mathematics and engineering. Although it is a relatively young field, computer science has produced many of the advances of modern life that we now take for granted. It has given medical researchers tools to understand and cure diseases, enabled physicists to reshape our understanding of the universe, allowed neuroscientists to uncover the secrets of our brains, and helped biologists decipher the human genome. Computer science has rewritten the rules of the entertainment industry and has transformed the way humans communicate with each other. A Computer Science degree granted by a liberal arts program is of special value today, as the world increasingly needs graduates who not only possess computer skills, but also apply them in a context of broad general learning. Graduates will be ready to take exciting and demanding jobs in the field or to continue their studies in pursuit of advanced scientific or professional degrees. The Department of Computer Science is a part of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, a world renowned center for the study of mathematics and computing. As part of the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) at NYU, the department offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree , two minors (one in computer science, and one in web programming and applications) and a joint minor in computer science/mathematics . The BA degree can also  be pursued with honors . Students may combine our degree with others throughout the College to create a personalized joint major. Two specific combined degrees are the joint major  in computer science/economics and the joint  major in computer science/mathematics .  The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE  Dual Degree in computer science and engineering  and an accelerated  master's program available to qualifying undergraduates. Some of our graduating students go on to graduate study (MS or PhD) in computer science at New York University or elsewhere, while others find many career opportunities in industry upon graduation. The goal of our program is to train students both in the fundamental principles of computer science and in related aspects of information technology. Majors are required to take Foundations of Science and may begin it in their second year. The Computer Science program embraces a rich variety of subjects and provides great flexibility, allowing students to tailor courses of study to their particular interests. Possible concentrations include computer graphics and computer vision, artificial intelligence and machine learning, networking, databases, and software development. Advanced undergraduate students can work on research projects with faculty members engaged in projects of mutual interest. The minor in computer science is designed primarily for mathematics and science majors whose work will require basic programming skills. The minor in web programming and applications is designed for humanities and social sciences students who plan to use computer application software such as spreadsheets, desktop publishing, multimedia, and Internet software extensively in their careers. More on our minor programs. The Computer Science program offers non-major courses for students from all backgrounds and fields.
