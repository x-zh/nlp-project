The majority of entering freshmen are in the top 10% of their class. Our undergraduate student body continues to be increasingly diverse. At NYU, the student body has no ethnic majority. In 2002, international students made up 4% of the total, and in 2012, that grew to 12% . The 2013 freshman class is 18% international from a record-breaking 87 countries . All 50 states are represented in the undergraduate student body. In 2012, African American and Latino/a students made up 19% of the freshman class, up from 11% in 2002. In 2013, 17% of the freshman class are first-generation college students. Institutional aid for undergraduates has increased by almost 138% between 2002 and 2012 (from $78,138,160 to $185,828,888), while aid for all students (undergraduate, graduate and PhD students) increased by 134% between 2002 and 2012. In 2002, the average aid award for new freshmen was $8,960, which covered 34% of tuition . In 2012, the average aid award for new freshmen was $23,721 and covered 55% of tuition . The difference comes from increases in financial aid and investing financial aid in a way that awards aid to students who need it most. Pell grants, in dollar terms, increased by 142% between 2002 and 2011 (from $8,648,286 to $20,896,467 ). Pell is an important metric of economic diversity. The freshman Pell Grant population at Yale is 13%, at Johns Hopkins, 12%, at Princeton, 11%, and at Tufts, 10%. The Pell Grant population among all students at NYU is 22%. The number of undergraduates studying abroad for a semester or more has almost doubled from 2002 to 2013. In 2002 we had 5 Global Academic Centers. Today we have 13 NYU locations away from New York, including our degree-granting campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai. 65% of classes have less than 20 students . This percentage has been stable for 10 years even with an increasing student body. The number of sections with 50 or more students has declined from 10 to 9 percent . Over 40 areas of study have been added at the Undergraduate level. There was $905 million invested in academic capital improvements across nine schools between 2002 and 2011. Over 50% of the general purpose classrooms have been renovated, replaced, or added since 2006. Over 50% of the general purpose classrooms have been renovated, replaced, or added since 2006. Between 2002 and 2011, there was $628 million invested in student housing and student services. Part of that investment was a move from leased to owned space, which will result in a cumulative cash flow surplus of $275 million over 30 years. There was $38 million spent on new faculty housing and $67 million invested in renovations and upgrades to existing faculty housing. Between 2007 and 2011, there was $349 million invested in renovations and upgrades and in replacing leased space with owned space. The purchase of 730 Broadway enabled the University to replace 140,000 square feet of leased space with 200,000 square feet of owned space. Between Fiscal Years 2002 and 2013. The endowment for all parts of the University including NYU Langone Medical Center was $3.121 billion at the end of fiscal 2013 – an increase of 175% . The data below include NYU's Washington Square campus and all NYU sites within the global network, but not the assets and operating results of NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. Net assets more than doubled over this period, to $3.6 billion . The University's Excess of Operating Revenues over Operating Expenses increased from $10 million to $63 million between 2002 and 2013, according to the University's audited financial statements.  As part of the the University's capital budgeting process, the University Board directs that the Excess of Operating Revenues over Operating Expenses be used as working capital in support of the University's capital requirements.  As such, it is annually budgeted for capital maintenance and other projects authorized by the Board. The University’s cash and unrestricted investments increased from $699 million in fiscal 2002 to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013. Total disbursements of financial aid increased by 151% , compared with a 105% increase in total revenue from tuition and fees.

As a percent of total expenditures, this category of expense increased from 57% in fiscal 2002 to 58% in fiscal 2013. The total expenditures for Auxiliary, General and Administrative, and Institutional Services were $577 million in fiscal 2013, an increase over the eleven year period of 62% . As a percent of total expenditures, this category of expense decreased from 29% in fiscal 2002 to 23% in 2013. During the period of major re-engineering of the University’s administrative and auxiliary services (2008 – 2010), this category of expenditure decreased by 5% , while Instruction, Research and Libraries increased by 10% . Depreciation and amortization increased as a percent of total expenditures from 5% in fiscal 2002 to 9% in fiscal 2013.  This reflects the major investments in the University’s physical plant over that time. NYU received the first public rating on its debt in 2008, and has maintained ratings of "Aa3" and "AA-" by Moody's and S&P, respectively, since that time. In just the last three years alone, NYU has swiftly risen in the World and US reputational and university rankings as measured by Times Higher Education .

Designed by The Office of Web CommunicationsDeferring Your EnrollmentNYUHome Login Students | Faculty | Alumni | Employees | Community Admissions / Undergraduate Admissions / Admitted Students Freshman applicants who have been offered admission to NYU may request to defer their enrollment for up to one year. Students who are approved to defer their enrollment and who satisfy the requirements listed below do not have to file a new application and are guaranteed re-admission for the subsequent fall semester. Deferred students pay a tuition deposit for the original term of entry, which will be credited to the new term of entry. Deferred students are then considered "Early Decision" admitted students for the new term of entry. They are expected to re-confirm their intention to enroll when our new Early Decision students are expected to do so in January and are held to the same expectations as our other Early Decision students. In essence, students who are approved to defer their enrollment are committed to enrolling at NYU but are simply making that commitment a year in advance. A new admit packet of materials, including a new offer of admission and Candidate Reply Form, will be mailed in December to students who have been approved to defer their enrollment. All students who have deferred their enrollment must confirm their intention to enroll for the subsequent fall by signing and returning the Candidate Reply Form by the deadline indicated in the new offer of admission. A new deposit will not be required. A new offer of admission will not be issued if a final high school transcript has not been received. Students who have been approved for deferred enrollment should understand the following: Students who are approved to defer their enrollment will be offered a space in one our NYU residence halls for the new term of entry. Housing is guaranteed for all of our freshmen who meet our deadlines and requirements. Though approval to defer one's enrollment is typically granted for one year, we do, on occasion, approve students to defer their enrollment for 2 or 3 years. Only students who need to complete compulsory military service or missionary work will be considered for this exception. Students will not be approved to defer their enrollment for 2 or 3 years in advance, and as a result, the second or third year of deferred enrollment must be requested and approved during January of the following year.

Follow Us: Google+ Facebook Twitter Vimeo YouTube © NYU School of EngineeringApplied Physics | NYU Polytechnic School of EngineeringPhysics deals with the constituents, properties, and evolution of the entire universe, on all length and time scales, and so is often said to be the most fundamental science. Applied Physics is the branch of physics where the implications and uses of fundamental physics knowledge are explored and exploited. The Applied Physics Department is committed to providing high-quality introductory, intermediate, and advanced-level physics courses to the School's engineering and science departments. Through our undergraduate major we train new generations of physicists capable of applying the tools of physics to contemporary problems for the benefit of all. And through close collaborations with other departments, we enable engineering research and education with physics knowledge and techniques, and serve as a catalyst for research in other scientific and engineering fields. Department Chair: Lorcan M. Folan Follow Us: Google+ Facebook Twitter Vimeo YouTube © NYU School of EngineeringDepartments | NYU Polytechnic School of EngineeringThe School of Engineering's academic departments reflect our deep academic roots and our dedication to adapting to the changing demands of scholarship and industry. For example, our Chemical and Biological Engineering department had its genesis during the first half of our history, as the Department of Chemical Engineering. As the need for bio-based chemistry grew, we met that demand with expanded curricula and dedicated researchers and faculty. And because we’re a smaller institution, our departments are nimble, able to do the interdisciplinary work that today’s advances require. Follow Us: Google+ Facebook Twitter Vimeo YouTube © NYU School of EngineeringApplied Physics, BS | NYU Polytechnic School of EngineeringApplied Physics is devoted to the study and understanding of nature. Considered the most fundamental science, it deals with the constituents, properties, and evolution of the entire universe, from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies. At the School of Engineering, our BS in Applied Physics students study physics while working directly alongside engineers. That relationship provides lasting value, as graduates learn to adapt their careers to existing opportunities. You’re encouraged to explore your interests in such fields as entrepreneurship, biophysics, or biomedical instrumentation. Integrated circuit electronics, scanning probe metrology, and computational science are also options. Best of all, your explorations can propel you toward a dual degree, particularly in subjects such as electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and chemistry. With a strong foundation in physics, many of our students go on to pursue advanced studies at the master’s level.

Civil engineers had a hand in the construction of each, and with quickly growing populations straining today’s infrastructures, they’re sure to spend time improving and building upon our built environment now and into the future. Join the School of Engineering's BS program in Civil Engineering and be a part of their ranks. You’ll train for a broad and exciting field with major impacts on society and its infrastructure. Our program is strongly practice-oriented, heavily emphasizing design, to prepare you for entry-level positions in any civil engineering sub-discipline or for graduate study. The Civil Engineering Department expects that within 3 to 5 years of graduating, its graduates will: The BS in Civil Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET ( www.abet.org ). Program outcomes are those abilities and skills that graduates are expected to have upon graduation with a BS in Civil Engineering degree. For these, the Department has adopted the 11 fundamental outcomes specified by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). They cover the full breadth and depth of the abilities and skills needed by modern engineering professionals. They are listed below with brief discussions of how each relates to the civil engineering profession. (a) An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering . Virtually all of civil engineering involves the application of mathematics and basic sciences to the solution of real-world infrastructure problems. Fundamental engineering skills evolve directly from science and mathematics. Students are immersed in these applications across all subdisciplines of civil engineering. (b) An ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data . Civil engineers must engage in a number of basic experiments, and be aware of how to collect, organize, report and interpret the results of basic experiments and direct field observations of infrastructure operations. In the program, students are exposed to a wide range of laboratory experiments, including experiments in fluid mechanics, material behavior under loading, soil properties and behavior, and others. They also are exposed to the collection of field data related to environmental conditions and problems, highway and street traffic, and the monitoring of structures. (c) An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints, such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability and sustainability. The program is heavily design-oriented. Several courses include full design-project laboratories, including Steel Sesign Project, Transportation Engineering, Foundation Design, Senior Design I & II, and others. Many additional courses have design components, and all students finish their academic programs with a comprehensive civil engineering capstone project. As the student progresses, the complexity of design applications increases, as do the number and breadth of practical constraints on potential solutions. (d) An ability to function on multidisciplinary teams. Modern engineering is not done by stand-alone engineers . Any significant project involves several engineers, perhaps with different engineering backgrounds, as well as non-engineers (planners, architects, financiers, managers, etc). Students have the opportunity to work in teams in several courses, but particularly in the capstone design project. (e) An ability to identify, formulate and solve engineering problems . Engineers do not just solve problems brought to them by others. Engineers must spot problems before they become evident and describe them in terms that expedite their solution. As students progress through the program, they increase their participation in identifying and framing problems, as well as in developing comprehensive solutions. (f) An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility. All professionals must be keenly aware of their general and professional ethical responsibilities to society in general, and to others who require and pay for their services. Like many professions, engineers, and civil engineers in particular, have specific ethical codes issued by professional societies with which they must comply. General ethical considerations are discussed throughout the curriculum, and several courses have a strong focus on the basis for, and application of, professional ethical code. (g) The ability to communicate effectively . To be an effective professional in the modern world, one must be an effective communicator. Engineers must explain their views and solutions to problems in ways that can be understood clearly by other professionals and by the public. Modern communication involves written and oral forms, and a wide variety of electronic media. NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering students are exposed to, and are required to use, all of these methods to prepare for their careers. (h) The broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, environmental and societal context . Engineers do not solve problems in a vacuum. Everything engineering professionals do affects the world around them. In the modern world economy, the “world” includes local neighborhoods, regions, states, nations and, indeed, the world. Solutions must be couched in a firm understanding of the impacts they will have on the environment, the economy and society. (i) A recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in, lifelong learning . The engineering profession changes rapidly with the technological world. While general principles tend to change slowly, the specific materials, analysis techniques and approaches to engineering change quite rapidly. The body of knowledge graduates leaves with must be updated constantly and expanded during their professional lives. The program provides opportunities for students to appreciate this need, and develop useful skills for self-learning, now and in the future. (j) Knowledge of contemporary issues . Engineering students study in a context in which local, regional and national infrastructure issues are in the forefront. Current issues and problems are discussed in virtually all courses, and students’ attention is called to immediate issues as they arise. (k) An ability to use the techniques, skills and modern engineering tools necessary for professional practice . The program is frequently updated to incorporate the latest approaches to engineering solutions, and to include the use of modern engineering tools. Important “tools” include a variety of computer programs for data analysis, simulation and design. Many course laboratories use the most up-to-date techniques and software packages available to engineering professionals. The Department of Civil Engineering has established additional requirements and interpreted the Institute guidelines ( found on this page ; additional information can be found in the catalog ). The 128-credit curriculum is fulfilled by combining transfer credits, credits by examination and courses taken at the School of Engineering. Transfer credits in mathematics, chemistry, physics, humanities and social sciences are evaluated by the Office of Academic Affairs with faculty guidance from specific departments. Transfer credits in civil engineering and other technical areas are evaluated by the faculty of the Department of Civil Engineering. The length of time for a transfer student to complete the BS in Civil Engineering depends upon 3 factors: Transfer students should understand that they can be awarded transfer credits for courses with a C grade or better and then only for courses that are applicable toward the BS in Civil Engineering curriculum. A residency requirement also must be fulfilled. To earn a BS, a student must complete a minimum of 30 credits at the School of Engineering at the junior or senior level (courses numbered CE 3XXX or CE 4XXX). These credits must include the design project, CE 4814. You may register as a part-time student (fewer than 12 credits a semester), though the department does not offer many undergraduate courses in the evening If you are enrolled as a part-time student, you should maintain close contact with your academic advisers to work out the details of course sequencing efficiently and effectively.

These systems have to be continuously adapted and upgraded (often with technology-driven solutions) to efficiently support the essential public services, urban development and economic growth. The infrastructure systems support a variety of urban sectors, including transportation, energy & water supply, sanitation & wastewater management,  and other essential services. Their sustainable development engages a wide variety of public and private sector stakeholders and greatly depends on a broad range of factors, such as public policy objectives, land use and geo-physical system characteristics, regulatory requirements, and other variables. Both Government and Industry presently face increasing needs for innovative capabilities of dynamic monitoring and “smart” system control to effectively meet the challenge of upgrading the aging urban infrastructure systems. With specialized faculty members from Government, Industry and Academia, the program is designed for professionals, with both engineering and non-engineering backgrounds, who are involved and/or interested in the fast growing inter-disciplinary field of urban systems management and career opportunities with government agencies, public and private sector utilities, and service industries across the wide array of the metropolitan sectors. This program is open to professionals with BS or BA degrees and backgrounds in engineering, science, public policy, management, economics, and/or finance. Necessary mathematics background, usually including undergraduate calculus, is required, as is an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better.

Thankfully, professionals trained in transportation planning and engineering help ease the pressure by devising real-time traffic controls, variable message signs, or other such solutions. Our PhD program in Transportation Planning and Engineering gives you the education you need to join their ranks. Research-oriented in focus, and intended for students with a desire to advance the state-of-the-art within the field, our curriculum offers concentrations in any of the following: Of course, specialization in areas other than those identified above is possible and can be nurtured with the help of faculty advisors. Admission to this program requires an MS in Transportation Planning and Engineering or equivalent, with a GPA of 3.5 or better (on a 0-4 scale). GRE scores are required for all full-time PhD applicants. Should you decide to take the tests, you must submit the results for consideration. Foreign applicants must take the TOEFL examination and submit the results for consideration. The “equivalent” of the MS degree can be achieved in several ways. For instance, you may have an MS degree with a different title that covers substantially the same material. More generally, you must demonstrate that you have the equivalent of all undergraduate and master’s level course work in order to pursue doctoral level work in the major area. Further, “equivalence” is evaluated based on the totality of your undergraduate and graduate record, not course-by-course. Because admission to this program requires a related MS (or equivalent), those of you who have not yet achieved a master’s degree would normally be admitted as MS students. You are expected to earn an MS degree while completing your major and minor course requirements. In rare cases, an applicant with only a BS degree may be directly admitted into the PhD program with the written approval of the department head. Transfer credits for PhD students can be awarded course by course. Alternatively, a MS degree from another institution may be accepted for transfer in toto . In the former case, a maximum of 42 credits of approved graduate work may be transferred. The latter requires a recommendation from the department’s Graduate Committee and the approval of the department head. Transfer credits are awarded generally at the time of admission and must be approved by the academic adviser, the transportation graduate coordinator and the department head.

The School of Engineering's PhD in Civil Engineering program produces graduates dedicated to enriching the field. Research-oriented and focused on the latest developments in the discipline, our program readies you for civil engineering research careers in the private sector. It also prepares you to teach at the university level, ensuring the most recent advancements in the field are shared with a new generation of civil engineers. As a PhD candidate, you will choose to concentrate in 1 of these sub-disciplines: Other focus areas are possible and can be developed with the assistance of faculty advisers. All subject areas must be relevant to the degree sought, and a faculty member must be willing and able to guide your research. In criteria 1 and 2 above, the “equivalent" can be achieved in several ways. You may have an MS degree with a different title that covers substantially the same material. In more general terms, you must demonstrate that you have the equivalent of all undergraduate and master’s-level course work to be able to pursue doctoral-level work in the chosen major area, as well as in a minor area within the umbrella of civil engineering. Further, “equivalence” is evaluated based on the totality of your undergraduate and graduate record, not course-by-course. Thus, if you wish to pursue doctoral work in Environmental Engineering, for example, you must have the entire undergraduate and master’s-level course background expected in Environmental Engineering, but you do not need to demonstrate such a background in structures. Because admission to a PhD program requires a relevant MS (or equivalent), applicants who have not yet achieved a master’s degree would normally be admitted as MS students. They are expected to earn an MS degree while completing their major and minor course requirements. In rare cases, an applicant with only a BS degree may be directly admitted into the PhD program with the written approval of the department head. If you are admitted to the PhD program, you will be assigned an academic advisor, who you should meet with shortly after receiving your acceptance letter. During your meeting you should establish your program of study, which will include a list of the fundamental and advanced topics that will comprise specific courses, the subject matter for your qualifying exam, and possible research areas. For additional information about your academic advisor and the Academic Advisory Committee that will help guide the completion of your qualifying examination, please refer to the Civil Engineering PhD section of the School of Engineering academic catalog beginning on page 149. A maximum of 39 credits of approved graduate work may be transferred and applied to your degree requirements. They be awarded on a course-by-course basis or by the transfer of a MS degree from another institution in satisfaction of 30 graduate credits. The latter requires a recommendation from the department’s Graduate Committee and the approval of the department head. Transfer credits are generally awarded at the time of admission and must be approved by the academic adviser, the graduate coordinator, and the department head.

Certain selected topics courses may be used to fulfill these requirements with written permission from the department. Additionally, for the following courses, you are required to take the course unless you have already taken an equivalent course (at either the graduate or undergraduate level) with a grade of B or higher. If you have taken an equivalent course and received a B grade or higher, you will not be permitted to take it at the School of Engineering as part of this PhD program without special permission: CS 6133 Computer Architecture I, Credits: 3.00 CS 6233 Introduction to Operating Systems, Credits: 3.00 CS 6033 Design and Analysis of Algorithms I, Credits: 3.00 CS 6373 Programming Languages, Credits: 3.00 The purpose of the qualifying exam is to assess your knowledge of computer science and your ability to perform dissertation-level research. You will be evaluated based on 2 components: a research exam and course work. After entering the PhD program, you will work on a research project under the direction of a research adviser. By the end of the second year, you must take a research exam based on this work. The research exam will be tailored to the your individual research, and will have the following 3 parts: (1) written report, (2) oral presentation, (3) answering questions posed by the research exam committee. The research exam will be used to assess your ability to do dissertation-level research. The exact format of the report and presentation can vary depending upon your research accomplishments up until that time and the focus area. You may schedule the research exams during 2 periods of time in the year; a range of dates around the end of the fall and spring semesters will be announced in advance by the graduate director. Your overall course performance will be evaluated as part of the qualifying exam process. Special emphasis will be given to performance in PhD core courses. If you take the research exam in your third semester, you must complete at least 4 PhD core courses by the end of your third semester in order for your course performance to be evaluated at the end of the third semester. Otherwise, your evaluation will be delayed until the end of the fourth semester, by which time you must have taken all 6 PhD core courses. Evaluation of your course performance will likely be based on a review your transcripts and possible consultation with your instructors. In special cases, you may be subject to additional evaluation and/or additional written exams in some core course areas. The Computer Science and Engineering faculty will examine your research-exam results and course performance to decide if you pass or fail the qualifying examination. They can also give you a conditional pass that imposes additional requirements and will be converted to a pass or fail grade. If you fail the qualifying exam on your first attempt, you may retake it once. You must make your second attempt by the end of the your fifth semester. If you do not pass the qualifying exam on your second attempt, you will be dismissed from the PhD program. You cannot register for dissertation credit until you have passed the qualifying exam. If you enter the PhD program with a master's degree in computer science, you are urged to take the research exam and at least 4 of the required core courses by the end of your third semester. This gives you the potential to pass the qualifying exam by the end of your third semester and to begin taking thesis credits in your fourth semester. The last, and most substantial, aspect of the PhD program is the dissertation. The dissertation must embody a significant original research contribution and must be written in accepted scholarly style. The research should be conducted in close consultation with your advisor. It is strongly recommended that you submit at least 1 paper on your research to a refereed archival journal or refereed conference. When your adviser feels that you have obtained sufficiently significant research results and that you have written an acceptable dissertation, a public dissertation defense will be scheduled. It will consist of your oral presentation and questions from the dissertation committee. Additional requirements for the PhD dissertation are available from the Office of the Associate Provost of Research and PhD programs. Follow Us: Google+ Facebook Twitter Vimeo YouTube © NYU School of EngineeringComputer Science, PhD | NYU Polytechnic School of EngineeringWe have a thriving PhD program with approximately 50 full-time PhD students hailing from all corners of the world. Most full-time PhD students have scholarships that cover tuition and provide a monthly stipend. Although admission is highly competitive, we seek creative, articulate students with undergraduate and master's degrees from top universities worldwide. Our current research strengths include Internet and web research, cybersecurity, graphics, visualization, vision and image processing, and theoretical computer science. Yi-Jen Chiang Follow Us: Google+ Facebook Twitter Vimeo YouTube © NYU School of EngineeringResearch | Computer Science and Engineering | NYU Polytechnic School of EngineeringThe department is active in research in a number of key areas of Computer Science. Our research has been funded by grants from government agencies such as the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Office of Naval Research, the Air Force, and the New York State Office of Science, Technology, and Academic Research, and private companies and foundations such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, the Sloan Foundation, Panasonic, Intel, and Verizon. Follow Us: Google+ Facebook Twitter Vimeo YouTube © NYU School of EngineeringFrequently Asked Questions | Computer Science, PhD | NYU Polytechnic School of EngineeringA. PhD admission decisions are made directly by the faculty of the department. Each admission is evaluated individually. The most important factors are previous academic background (GPA and courses taken), letters of reference, previous research experience, relevant professional experience, GRE scores, and statement of purpose. In addition, the candidate's area of interest and area of previous research or work experience may also play an important role, and applicants whose background matches current research activities in the department will have a better chance. On the other hand, if you plan to pursue research in an area that is not represented at all in our department, then your chances will be lower and we would recommend applying to another school instead. A. Scores for the GRE General Score are required from all applicants. We do not require scores for the CS subject test, but you may submit them as part of your application. A. We consider your entire application to make decisions on admission and support. A high GRE score alone does not guarantee admission. There are also no specified minimum scores for the GRE, but be aware that admission is highly competitive so high scores are expected unless there is some other significant strength in the application that can make up for it. A. No, a Masters degree is not required, and people with undergraduate or graduate degrees can apply. A. Yes, though we expect you to have significant background in CS or closely related fields. Admission is unlikely if we conclude that significant course work would be needed to make up for missing background in CS. For closely related fields such as Computer Engineering or EE this may often not be a big problem, but if your undergraduate background is in a very different field, then first getting an MS degree in CS may be a better idea. A. You may be able to transfer some credits into our PhD program. Students with a completed Masters degree in CS may transfer 30 credits, while some relevant credits may be transferable for those with graduate degrees or credits in EE and other closely related fields, as decided on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the department. Decisions about such transfers will usually be made after you arrive at the NYU School of Engineering. Also, if you already have a Masters degree in CS from another institution, then you will not be awarded another MS degree from the NYU School of Engineering. Having already a Masters degree can be advantageous if it shows that a candidate has strong and broad background and/or if it includes some research. On the other hand, we may also expect more from somebody who already has a Masters degree. A. The PhD program is based at the Brooklyn campus, and PhD students are expected to pursue their studies there. Almost all faculty involved in the program are based in Brooklyn, and most of the research activities in the department take place there as well. In particular, our graduate centers at Westchester and Long Island are focused on supporting MS-level studies and do not have any PhD students. A. Yes, students will be able to do research in Abu Dhabi/Shanghai. There are currently a limited number of PhD students who work with faculty members at NYU AD but are officially enrolled in the NYU School of Engineering CS PhD program. If you are interested in working with one of the faculty members at these sites, you should contact them. In the future, we also expect that some students will work with our faculty on the new Shanghai campus. A. All applications must be submitted online. A link to the online application is available here . A. Admission to the PhD program is separate from the MS program, and is significantly more competitive. You need to apply for the PhD program like everybody else. Be aware that to be considered for the PhD program, you should be among the top students in the MS program. Also, most MS students who transfer to the PhD program are involved in research during their MS studies. Talk to a faculty member or the graduate advisor before applying for a transfer into the PhD program. A. The earlier you start planning ahead the better. Ask a faculty member for advice. Consider working on some research with a faculty member. Research experience is usually more important for getting into a good program than a slightly better GRE. Do not start planning in your final year. Also consider schools other than the NYU School of Engineering. While we always like to get good students, a change of institution can sometimes be healthy for your academic career. A. No, though it is highly desirable if you have some. Make sure to describe such experience in your statement and try to get a letter of reference discussing it. Research experience is particularly important for applicants who already have a Masters degree, while for students who are still undergrads it is less common to have a significant research record. In general, we are looking for applicants who have shown scholarship and initiative beyond the basic degree requirements. Also discuss relevant professional experience in your statement and resume. A. Yes, though we believe that it is not always a good idea to pursue a PhD part-time. We understand there are circumstances where full-time study is not possible and try to accommodate part-time students, but otherwise we strongly recommend going full-time, at least for some of the duration of study. In our experience, being part-time greatly increases the time it takes to finish the program and decreases the success rate. Consider carefully how this fits into your professional situation. There are some employers (such as colleges or research labs) that may be very supportive in terms of giving time off or tuition support. Note that part-time students typically do not receive financial support such as scholarships or assistantships from the department. Contact the advisor and discuss such plans with our faculty. A. Basically, yes, but let's be more precise. For applicants that indicate that they require financial support to attend, or that do not show sufficient financial resources in their application, we will typically only offer admission if we can offer sufficient financial support (though there may be exceptions). For applicants that have other support, we may sometimes admit people without offering support (see also next item). A. The answer may depend on the type of funding you already have. If you have an outside scholarship (say, a US or foreign government or private scholarship) or a commitment by a company to support you over several years, then we would expect you to use this funding if admitted. If you show personal and family funds as your source of support, then we would assume that you would still prefer getting support from us, and that you would not be happy to entirely support yourself from those funds over the several years of your PhD study. In that case, chances are that you would be considered the same as applicants requiring support. In some case, when we do not have enough funding to support all strong applicants, we may offer admission without support in the first year, with the expectation that the department will make an effort to find support in the second year if the student maintains a strong record in the first year. A. Please do not email multiple faculty members to ask about admission and possibilities for support. You may contact an individual faculty member if your research interests and background are directly related to his/her work. But please do not broadcast requests to all faculty. To inquire on the status of your application, please contact the Director of Graduate Studies. A. Yes, you can still apply a little later. We STRONGLY recommend applying by the deadline though. If you apply later, your chances of obtaining support will be diminished, and very late applications will likely not receive any consideration for support. For admission without support, you may apply until April 30, but earlier is better. Be aware that for international students, some time is needed for the visa process, so very late applications might run into problems even if no support is requested. A. Usually not, except in cases such as internal transfers into the program or when a faculty member recommends a particular student for admission and agrees to provide support. Other applications are usually only evaluated once a year in the spring for the next fall semester. A. The NYU School of Engineering has a very limited availability for on-campus housing. PhD students usually prefer to rent and share apartments off-campus. A. We require at least 2 letters, but strongly recommend asking for 3-4 letters. Some of the letters may be from job supervisors and employers, but we strongly recommend that at least 2 should be from faculty at your undergraduate (and graduate if applicable) places of study. If you have been out of school for several years, nonetheless make an effort to contact those faculty members and ask for a letter. Do not apply with multiple letters from various employers. Letters should address previous research experience that you might have had during your studies. A. For applications for financial support that meet the December 15 deadline, decisions are typically made between Feb and early April. For other applications that arrive later, decisions should be made within two months after we receive the application, in some cases much faster. For admissions with financial support, we follow the guidelines of the Council of Graduate Schools. This means that we try to make offers before April 15, and we will not require a binding decision before April 15. Any decision to accept our offer of admission with support will be considered binding. Occasionally we may decide to make offers of support after April 15, due to additional funding becoming available. In that case, you will get a limited amount of time (1-2 weeks) to make a binding decision. A. You can check the status of the application here . Be advised that the status may be out-of-date due to the huge amount of applications to be processed by the Graduate Admissions office. If you have urgent need to enquire about the status of your application (such as an approaching deadline to accept an offer from anther university), you may contact the PhD Admissions Chair. Please allow at least a couple of weeks after submitting your application before inquiring about the status of your application. A. If you still have questions after reading about the PhD program, curriculum, and the FAQ page, you may contact the PhD Program Director with your queries. A. If the department needs to contact you, it will be done using the email address you provided in your application. Please continue to monitor the email address you gave us on your application, as all future communications until we make a decision about your application will be directed to that email address.

PIB was chartered in 1854 and in the same year NYU began is first engineering program. (NYU had been the site for earlier work in 1840 by Samuel F. B. Morse and Alfred Vail on a recording telegraph.) The Electrical Engineering (EE) Program was started at PIB in 1886. The EE Department was formed in 1890. Samuel Sheldon, who served as its head for the first 30 years, was the second president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. The first EE degrees were awarded in 1891. Bancroft Gherardi, Jr. was one of the two graduates. He went on to become vice president and chief engineer of AT&T, and to win the IEEE Edison Medal in 1932. An earlier graduate, Rober G. Brown (class of 1868) designed and developed the first telephone system in Paris, France. Among his other innovations were the "French Telephone," with its separate hand piece (carrying the speaker and microphone) which rested in a cradle, and the hiring of women to work as telephone operators. NYU awarded its first EE degree in 1926, and Polytechnic began offering part-time evening graduate study programs in that same year. Polytechnic awarded its first PhD degrees in EE in 1937. Polytechnic's educational and research programs in electrical engineering grew rapidly in scope and quality during the 1940's due to defense technology needs of World War II and the leadership of Ernst Weber, who joined the school after having been educated in Vienna, Austria. Pioneering research, development and production activities for microwave electronics components led to formation of the Polytechnic Research and Development Corp. (PRD) in 1944 and the Microwave Research Institute MRI in 1945. Development of related educational programs grew after Dr. Weber became department head in 1945, leading to the initiation of graduate degrees in Electrophysics in 1960. Research and academic programs in electrophysics enjoyed strong leadership from Herbert Carlin (head of Electrophysics 1961-66), Nathan Marcuvitz (head of MRI 1957-66), Leo Felsen, Arthur Oliner (head of MRI 1967-85, head of EE & EP 1971-74), Theo Tamir (head of EE 1974-79), and Erich Kunhardt (head of MRI 1986-90). Research in the area of systems and control flourished under the leadership of John Truxal (Department head from 1957-1962). As a result graduate degrees in Systems Engineering were begun. The most important work in the circuits and systems area was guided by Dante C. Youla, who was awarded the IEEE Control System Field Award in 1988. The first computer course was offered in 1951. The first leader of computer research and educational programs was Edward Smith, who later served as department head (1967-71, 1979-81). Computer Science degree programs were initiated by faculty forming a division of CS within the EE department. A separate Computer Science Department was formed in 1990. Telecommunication activities developed significantly after publication of pioneering textbooks by Mischa Schwartz (department head 1962-65) and Athanasios Papoulis. Polytechnic's growing eminence in that field was recognized by the selection in 1983 of its Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications for major continuing support from the New York State Science and Technology Foundation. Under the leadership of Richard van Slyke and Ivan Frisch, both developers of networking systems that led to the Internet, CATT developed several related degree programs and made technical contributions to many new firms in that field. More recent department heads include: Leonard Shaw, 1982-90 (systems and signal processing); Henry Bertoni, 1990-95 (wireless and electromagnetics); Zivan Zabar, 1995-98 (electrical power systems); Unni Pillai, 1998-99 (signal processing); David Goodman, 1999-2001 (wireless networks); Henry Bertoni, 2001-04 (wireless and electromagnetics); H. Jonathan Chao, 2004-Present (networks).

Further, globalization of finance and insurance combined with the increased role of sovereign states that operate in financial markets and determine regulatory rules are increasingly leading to economic strategies based on political and national agendas rather than just based on market forces. These factors as well as the convergence of insurance, credit risk and their derivatives, and financial risk management are contributing to a need for a comprehensive approach to risk finance. The Risk Finance track at the School of Engineering addresses these important developments by providing a specialization that bridges theory and practice and prepares students for challenging careers in risk finance, insurance, credit risk and derivatives, and financial risk management.

An important part of NYUCD's research strategy is translational research. We firmly believe that in today's world, groups of researchers must work together synergistically in order to move fundamental basic science research into practice. This collaborative, integrated approach drives the majority of the research conducted today at the NYU College of Dentistry. The College’s distinguished dental faculty includes more than 735 full- and part-time clinicians and researchers, including many who have made pioneering contributions in the areas of caries research across the age spectrum, salivary diagnostics, cancer, especially oral cancer, bone health, especially osteoporosis research, behavioral research, HIV research, pain control, implant dentistry, the development of new dental materials, the use of fluoride and dental sealants to prevent caries, bonding techniques to restore the appearance of damaged teeth, the correction of facial deformities, and orthodontic services for adults.EndodonticsChair : Asgeir Sigurdsson, cand. odont., DDS, MS, cert. endo (UNC) Diplomate of the American Board of Endodontics and Associate Professor, Endodontics The educational goals of the predoctoral program are to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve competency in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of pulpal and periapical disease. This goal is achieved by offering the dental student an integrated endodontic experience in didactics, laboratory exercises and patient care with an emphasis on differential diagnosis, emergency care and interdisciplinary treatment. Diagnosis of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component) Endodontics is introduced as part of a multi-disciplinary course.  The course enables the student to record the 						patient's chief complaint, medical and dental history, as well as extra-and intraoral examination and pulp and 						periapical tissue evaluation.  The student will be able to differentiate pathosis of odontogenic and nonodontogenic 						origin.  An essential goal of this course is to present material that allows students to learn the methods for 						establishing an accurate pulpal and periapical clinical diagnosis. Management of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component) This course component introduces the student to nonsurgical and surgical endodontic treatment modalities.  The 						biological rationale of endodontic treatment is presented.  The use of basic and new methods of instrumentation are 						introduced. Complex Restoration I (Endodontic Preclinical Laboratory Technique Component) A series of laboratory technique sessions introduce the dental student to the fundamental procedures involved in root 						canal access, instrumentation and obturation.  Each laboratory session is preceded by an instructional lecture 						covering the goals and objectives for each exercise.  Basic and advanced instruments and techniques involving hand 						and rotary root canal preparation are included in course exercises. Advanced Endodontics This course, for third-year dental students, consists of a series of lectures on advanced endodontic topics.  The 						information presented enables the student to examine, diagnosis and appropriately treat pulpal and periapical disease. 						Students are also taught to evaluate and treat endodontic emergencies.The evaluation of outcomes in terms of 						prognosis, possible complications and the restorative phase of treatment is stressed. Endodontic Clinic This course provides the third-year dental student with the opportunity to treat patients who require endodontic care 						under faculty supervision.  Correlations between endodontic biology and fundamental and current treatment modalities 						are emphasized. Endodontic Clinic This course provides the fourth-year dental student the opportunity to treat patients who have more complex endodontic 						needs, including selected molars. Interdisciplinary concerns are also a component of treatment planning these cases. Honors in Endodontics This course is offered to a small group of highly motivated students with a high level of academic achievement who are 						particulary interested in endodontics.  This course presents a series of lectures and seminars on advanced and current 						endodontic topics that incorporate the biology of endodontic disease and the comprehensive clinical management of 						complex endodontic cases. > Advanced Education Program in Endodontics > International Program in EndodonticsBiomaterials & BiomimeticsActing Chair: Louis Terracio, PhD Vice Dean for Research and Professor, Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology The department has a long history of academic performance with contributions to all programs of the College. Biomaterials play a fundamental role in most dental diagnostic and restorative procedures. The department’s programs are enhanced by a long history of funded research and an extensively equipped research suite for biomaterials development and characterization, much of it centered around new materials, biological models, calcium phosphate chemistry, and investigations on hard tissue architecture and regeneration. The department’s educational and research role is enhanced by  				          the M.S. Degree Program in Biomaterials and Biomimetics, offered in  				          collaboration with the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science. This  				          provides the opportunity for dental graduate and postgraduate students  				          to work on a broad range of research projects in collaboration with  				          graduate students with materials and engineering backgrounds. The student  				          educational experience is also strengthened by interaction with visiting  				          scholars from other research institutions from around the world. The Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics contributes to the undergraduate  				        dental educational program with lectures and laboratory exercises that  				        are integrated into freshman and sophomore General Dentistry Simulation  				        Programs to provide timely presentation of biomaterials course content. These first two years programs are then enhanced by presentations integrated  				          into the junior-year program covering the latest research findings and  				          the translation of these into new clinical techniques and restorative  				          and reconstructive philosophies. This requires close coordination with  				          the other clinical departments of the Division of Reconstructive and  				          Comprehensive Care and with the Division of Diagnostics, Infectious  				          Disease, and Health Promotion. These projects involve high school students, dental students, postgraduate dentists, MS students, faculty, and visiting scholars and researchers.Basic Science & Craniofacial BiologyChair: Nicola C. Partridge, PhD Professor, Basic Science & Craniofacial Biology Associate Chair: Eric Baker, M.Phil Adjunct Associate Professor, Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology The Department of Basic Science is one of the largest departments in the College, established by the fusion of six separate departments under one chair. NYUCD is one of a handful of private dental schools with its own basic science faculty. The faculty participates in all aspects of the college life: education, scholarly activity, research, and service. In addition, they teach in all programs of the College: graduate, postgraduate, and allied health. Members of the department are nationally and internationally renowned scientists, educators, and academic leaders. Research includes the study of: Department of Basic Science & Craniofacial Biology Faculty involved in biological anthropology research include: Research includes the study of fundamental mechanisms of apoptosis and programmed cell death, prostate cancer metastasis to bone, and studying premalignant to malignant cell transformation using human oral epithelial cells. The latter includes research on mutagenesis in lacZ mice, investigations of tobacco use and oral cancer, and the role of bacteria and inflammation in oral cancer. Department of Basic Science & Craniofacial Biology Faculty involved in cancer research include: Research includes the study of: Faculty involved in craniofacial & bone biology research include: Members of the department have close collaborations with the bone and cartilage research group in Biomaterials & Biomimetics and also with the NYU School of Medicine.

Wolff, DDS, PhD Professor, Cariology and Comprehensive Care Associate Chair: Kenneth L. Allen, DDS, MBA Clinical Associate Professor, Cariology and Comprehensive Care Associate Chair: David Hershkowitz, DDS Clinical Associate Professor, Cariology and Comprehensive Care The Department of Cariology and Comprehensive Care is responsible for the education of predoctoral students in the various modalities of dental anatomy, cariology, operative and aesthetic dentistry, communication skills, community based dentistry, and overall patient care. In addition, one of the important goals of the department is to prepare students to provide comprehensive care to patients in a modern group practice setting. As a result, students from all four years, D1 through D4, are integrated in group practices under the direction of group practice directors. Group practice directors mentor students in each of their groups toward competency and clinical experiences with the assistance of generalist and specialty faculty. In this regard, Cariology and Comprehensive Care interacts closely with all the specialty areas to meet the established goals and objectives of the department. Critical thinking is augmented through small group case discussion and through interdisciplinary seminars. Additionally, group interaction, with junior-year students acting as junior members of the group, and practice management seminars and assignments provide all members of the group the opportunity to gain the fundamental elements of managing a dental practice. The Department of Cariology and Comprehensive Care provides academic training for all classes in the predoctoral program. Included in this are the Integrated Case Seminars, where all 4 classes -- D1 through D4 -- come together to present a case of interest and present how the science of disease relate to the patient and their overall medical and dental treatment. The Department of Cariology and Comprehensive Care’s Simulation Program offers courses in Dental Anatomy and Operative Dentistry. Students continue to treat patients under faculty supervision working  toward achieving the minimal clinical experiences needed to achieve  competency. The Faculty Practice rotation permits students  to provide care at the NYU Dental Faculty Practice office. The Faculty  Practice provides a wide variety of comprehensive dental care to varying  student/staff populations who have affiliations with New York  University. The Department of Cariology and Comprehensive Care has a clinical research centered program. A particular emphasis is on clinical studies for modification of tooth surfaces to remove the ecologic niches critical for viability of bacteria associated with the carious process. Additional clinical research on burs that selectively cut only carious dentin are being conducted by members of the department in the College's Bluestone Center for Clinical Research . The Department of Cariology and Comprehensive Care conducts industrial funded and NIDCR funded research in a variety of areas. Members of the department have expertise in clinical trials involving dental materials, dentinal hypersensitivity, implant restoration, oral malodor, gingivitis, calculus accumulation, periodontal disease, and tooth whitening. In addition, Department members conduct research to understand the relative contribution of genetics and environment to oral diseases. This can be accomplished utilizing epidemiological approaches, analysis of the oral microbiota and of host-derived markers to characterize the exacerbation and prevention of oral diseases. Current research funding within the department is $3,800,000 per year.Epidemiology & Health PromotionChair: Richard Niederman, DMD Professor, Epidemiology & Health Promotion The mission of the Department of Epidemiology & Health Promotion is to provide the NYU College of Dentistry and NYU as a whole with vibrant, creative, and rigorous academic leadership in education, research, and service within the areas of epidemiology and health promotion. A fundamental component of the Department's mission is to provide excellence in teaching across the broad array of academic disciplines at the predoctoral, postdoctoral, and graduate school levels. Departmental teaching for the DDS curriculum focuses on foundational knowledge and practical application to the practice of dentistry for the following subjects: epidemiology, health promotion, bioethics, biostatistics, skills in assessing the professional literature, and public health issues and policy for the dental practitioner. Teaching at the Master's level provides a two-year MS program in Clinical Research , as well as contributions to the Global MPH program offered at the university level. The Department also seeks to partner fully with the NYU Global Institute of Public Health as it builds its educational and research programs in global public health. Most recently at the MS level, the Department led the formation of a new, one-year, full-time MS in Evidence-Based Practice degree program. Moreover, the Department was created and constituted to undertake and achieve major original research and other scholarly activities, and thus to provide national leadership for, and contributions to, the fields of epidemiology and health promotion. The NYU College of Dentistry's DDS curriculum sets the national trend in the teaching of epidemiology and health promotion, with a solid series of foundational didactic and preclinical courses. The four-year curriculum in Skills in Assessing the Professional Literature (SAPL) also sets the national standard for the teaching of EBD. Similarly, the Department's MS in Clinical Research program is a unique offering among US dental schools in that we are the only dental school offering an MS in Clinical Research degree. The recent addition of the MS in Evidence-Based Practice, a one-year full-time program, is the first established in a dental college in the US. The Department also houses the Oral Health Concentration within NYU's MPH in Global Health program, and offers a joint DDS-MPH degree opportunity. The PhD in Epidemiology program, run in collaboration with Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University, is now in its 21st year of operation. The Department has had a major commitment to research and scholarly activities since its inception in June 2000.Over its first 13 years of existence, the Department has received over $55 million in over 20 externally funded grants, most from the NIH, in which Departmental faculty serve as the PI or co-PI of the study. The research portfolio has included: In addition, the Department recently completed four five-year cycles of NIDCR/NIH funding for its NYU Oral Epidemiology T32 NRSA Training Grant, and is now launching a new version of that program, the NYU Global Postdoctoral Oral Epidemiology Training (POETS) program, which will also offer the PhD in epidemiology (again, in collaboration with the Department of Epidemiology at Columbia University), but now focused on international applicants. Finally, several Departmental faculty members serve as research mentors for clinical faculty at NYU, both in the College of Dentistry and in the School of Medicine. The Departmental faculty involve themselves in a wide variety of  community and University activities that vary year-by-year.    Departmental faculty run the NYU Spaghetti & Science Society, a  monthly student club that meets in an Italian restaurant in Greenwich  Village to discuss a scientific article over "a plate of pasta and a  glass of wine."  In past activities, a faculty member developed and  taught a six-week earth sciences module on wind energy versus nuclear  energy at the Salk Science School, a NYC magnet science Jr. High School.   Another faculty member has served as the program officer for a NYC  service to bring geriatric dental services to needy New Yorkers, while  another serves on several NYC and New York State health boards. The Department of Epidemiology & Health Promotion was created in  June 2000. During the first 13 years of its existence, the Department  faculty served as PI or co-PI on new grants  totaling more than $55M  from a range of national and state agencies. The Department currently  houses the following graduate degree programs:  the PhD in Epidemiology  program, established in 2000 jointly with Columbia University's  Department of Epidemiology; both the Certificate and the MS in Clinical  Research programs (which began in 2002); and the Oral Health  Concentration for the Global MPH (which began in  2006).Oral & Maxillofacial SurgeryChair : Robert S. Glickman, DMD Professor, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery The mission of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery is to train clinicians and scientists to advance current knowledge in the field, to encourage the discovery of improved therapies and to serve the public by providing quality surgical care. The Anthony S. Mecca Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery dates back to 1867, when the first organized course in oral surgery was offered by what was then known as the New York College of Dentistry. The course consisted of didactic lectures supplemented by cadaver operations and weekly clinics. As the specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery evolved, so too did the department. By 1915 daily clinics in diagnosis and treatment of surgical conditions including impactions, neoplasms, fractures, and infections were taught. Later, classes in local anesthesia, nitrous oxide, general anesthesia, and patient assessment were added. Many surgeons responsible for the changing face of the specialty were also leaders of the Anthony S. Mecca Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at NYU — among them Drs. Leo Winter, Harry Seldin, and William Harrigan. The oral and maxillofacial surgery faculty at NYU today embraces the traditions of the past while contributing to the future development of the specialty. The didactic curriculum in oral and maxillofacial surgery focuses on surgical application of the basic biomedical sciences. This is accomplished via a series of lectures in the second and third years and augmented by small group seminars and case discussions scheduled during the assigned clinical rotations in the third year. The second-year lecture series in oral and maxillofacial surgery occurs as part of the Survey of Dental Specialties course. An introduction to the basic principles of the discipline including techniques of administration of local anesthesia, basic exodontias armamentarium and technique, fundamental surgical principles including asepsis, wound healing and hemostasis, complex exodontias, management of dentoalveolar infections, management of soft tissue and dentoalveolar injuries, prevention and management of surgical complications, and surgical considerations in management of the cleft lip/palate patient are all addressed in a multidisciplinary case-based format. A series of bench lab exercises in local anesthesia technique, flap design and suture technique, and vital signs and management of medical emergencies complement this lecture series. The third-year didactic course in advanced oral and maxillofacial surgery focuses on more advanced surgical topics including impactions, preprosthetic surgery, implants, bone grafts and reconstructive surgery, management of benign and malignant lesions of the jaws, temporomandibular joint surgery, orthognathic surgery and correction of dentofacial anomalies, mandibular and midface trauma management. This core of lectures is supplemented by daily small group seminars and complex case discussion sessions, which are scheduled during the clinical rotation in oral and maxillofacial surgery. The third-year clinical course in oral and maxillofacial surgery consists of two one-week rotations during which the students are fully immersed in all of the activities of the department including performing exodontias procedures, surgical consultations, and postoperative evaluations; assisting complex dentoalveolar surgical cases; and assisting or observing sedation cases and operating room cases at the College and at affiliate hospitals. Students attend weekly departmental rounds and daily small group seminars. The emphasis is placed on total perioperative patient management skills in addition to clinical surgical experiences. The fourth-year clinical course in oral and maxillofacial surgery consists of a one-week OMS hospital rotation assignment during which the student hones skills in dentoalveolar surgery and gains additional exposure to complex major oral and maxillofacial procedures including ambulatory anesthesia cases and operating room assisting and observation. The students participate in all service activities including rounds, lectures, seminars, and clinical assignments. Students are also assigned to sessions in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic where they gain experience in the management of oral surgery emergencies. The Honors Program in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery accepts two senior students each year. These students are assigned faculty mentors on a rotating basis to ensure exposure to all activities within the department. Students spend one half-day per week in the clinic where they are assigned advanced dentoalveolar cases. In addition they attend resident lectures and seminars and/or cases on a rotating basis. The students also work with faculty mentors on research projects or case reports and abstracts suitable for presentation. Training in basic life support and cardiopulmonary resuscitation occurs biannually to ensure that all students are certified according to the standards of the American Heart Association. Basic life support training includes recognition of early warning signs and appropriate entry into the emergency medical system. The students are taught recognition of and appropriate intervention for respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and foreign body airway obstruction in the conscious and unconscious individual. This training is supplemented by lectures on management of common medical emergencies and review of the NYUCD medical emergency protocol during the third-year OMS clinical course. > Advanced Education Program in Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, 6-year MD Program > Advanced Education Program in Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, 4-year Certificate Program > Programs for International Dentists: Oral SurgeryFrequently Asked Questionsgo to calendar For the 2013 cycle, NYUCD received over  5,000 applications for admission to the 4-year DDS program.

To have impact on the city and commercial partners, and to give students real world experience, CUSP’s research program contains projects with goals and deliverables that develop or integrate technologies to specific ends (for example, understand and improve congestion and emergency response). CUSP also has core activities that foster the expertise required to execute projects, and that inform its educational curriculum. CUSP research is centered on an organizational structure based on disciplines, domains, and projects. The social sciences are an important enabler for CUSP activities — people are the customers and operators of urban systems, and understanding them and their behavior is essential to the CUSP mission. Conversely, CUSP’s large, multi-modal data sets will revolutionize the social sciences. Close interaction between the urban engineering and social science disciplines will be a CUSP hallmark, particularly among NYU and CUSP partner universities. Additionally, at the fertile intersection of the social sciences and “big data,” a principal challenge is to formulate the correct questions. A scenario you can expect at CUSP: social scientists bring us a question, CUSP researchers figure out how to acquire relevant data, then together with social scientists analyze and interpret that data. CUSP supported personnel anchor their research activities in CUSP’s offices. There are many drivers that influenced CUSP’s decision to co-locate its activities — the multidisciplinary nature of CUSP education and research, the power of serendipitous “water cooler” interactions, the goal to be a presence in Downtown Brooklyn, and the energy derived from collocating teams. Moreover, the inherent multidisciplinary complexity of many urban science challenges necessitates having a resident critical mass of research capabilities. CUSP research and academic activities have a domain/discipline structure that is very different from the usual department construct, and to important effect. Disciplines are core informatics capabilities. CUSP is focused on the study of urban informatics — the collection, integration, and analysis to improve the efficiency of urban systems. The disciplines are organized as cross‐cutting areas. Research topics include “big data” fields of databases, visualization, systems, machine learning and data mining, as well as applied statistics, operations research, decision models and optimization, geographical information systems, and sensing (including the development of novel physical sensors). Domains are the fields of expertise directly relevant to urban systems (mass transit, law enforcement, buildings, land use, public health, etc.). The domains correspond to relevant NYC partner agencies. Organizing around the “what” of a problem (e.g., acquire transport data, model building energy efficiency, measure noise temporally and spatially) instills a pragmatic ethos while encouraging interactions among faculty pursuing diverse “how” approaches to a problem. The choice and granularity of CUSP’s initial set of disciplines and domains are under development. CUSP’s vision is for an instrumented city that will yield data for researchers and students to collect, analyze, and interpret in order to improve the everyday lives of New Yorkers and the long-term health and efficiency of New York City. Sensors and cameras placed on traffic choke points, for example, would inform road design and signaling methods that speed commutes. An infrared picture of the Manhattan skyline also holds many points of inquiry. Is the dense red an indication of an overheated building, or poor insulation allowing heat to escape? What can be done to mitigate the overheating/heat loss, and what would be the cumulative effect to energy usage if smartly applied across NYC? CUSP will tackle such issues under the framework of “projects,” in collaboration with city agencies and industry partners. The projects will be major and minor in scope, resources, and duration. In many cases, data sources already exist for such projects, awaiting CUSP researchers to unlock their potential to make the city run more efficiently and effectively. There are also opportunities for CUSP to devise data collection methods through existing or novel instruments, such as sensors for both in situ and remote measurement. The totality of CUSP projects, built on its disciplinary and domain strengths, will over time, create an unprecedented “systems view” of NYC operations. CUSP projects will possess important economic implications as well — from the jobs created to implement CUSP-proposed development, to the new ventures that could spin off from CUSP technologies. CUSP will lead a new class of personal data users: non-profit research and academic institutions that will primarily use these data for educational and research purposes. In addition, CUSP will be tapping into novel data streams that have not traditionally been subject to privacy or security concerns. We will establish internal policies and principles to ensure proper protection of individual privacy without keeping our researchers and students from “doing science.” These policies will lead the research community in establishing industry-wide ethical standards and principles. We need to always keep in mind the ethical, legal, and societal implications of our research. CUSP’s scope is urban informatics — the collection, integration, and analysis of data to improve the operation of urban systems and enhance the quality of life. To achieve this, CUSP will observe and analyze existing operations; utilize existing and newly emerging data streams; and explore and deploy novel urban sensors in order to model New York City as a system of living networks. Such activities require data curation and integration capabilities, an urban GIS capability, urban modeling and simulation capabilities. These tools, adapted to NYC, will be the institutional foundations that enable CUSP research and education. They must be capable, reliable, useable, interoperable, and universally available to CUSP researchers and students. Noise is clearly a huge quality-of-life issue in urban settings. It directly impacts the health of a city’s population, correlates with urban problems ranging from crime to compromised educational settings, and affects real estate values. While a number of interesting studies have focused on specific contexts and effects of urban noise, no comprehensive city-wide study has been undertaken that can provide a validated model for studying urban noise in order to develop long-lasting interventions at the operational or policy level. New York City, with its population, its agency infrastructure, and its ever-changing urban soundscape provides an ideal venue for a comprehensive study and attack on problems of urban noise. The growing volume of data on buildings and their occupants presents the opportunity to expand our fundamental understanding of the urban built environment and the flows of energy, water, and waste within it. Coupled with the ability to use synoptic remote sensing, the acquisition, integration, and analysis of large-scale data can shift investment behavior and support data-driven decisions to improve building energy efficiency. For cities, targeted policies to maximize energy efficiency can be a cost-effective way to reduce total consumption and peak demand, lower carbon emissions, stimulate new investment, and create “good” jobs. The ability to manage demand and optimize across transportation systems is key to improving operational efficiency and more effectively meeting customer expectations. Transportation service providers are confronted with rising costs, aging infrastructure, and environmental requirements, while continuing to meet the needs of a growing urban population. There are major challenges in understanding, monitoring, assessing, and making operational decisions necessary in complex multi-modal transportation systems. To make effective data driven decisions we must decrease the time required to collect, analyze, and provide actionable information to system operators and users. For example: The effects of Hurricane Sandy on NYC and surrounding regions highlighted the combined danger of extreme weather events and the reality of global climate change. Although federal, state, and local governments responded effectively to the demands of the catastrophic storm, there will be several “lessons learned” that will demand a more in-depth examination of effects and responses. The result will point the way to developing cost effective risk management and emergency management practices that address preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery for both natural and man-made disasters to assure safety and security. Also, the work will enable the assessment of needs to harden the key components of urban infrastructure in order to adapt to climate change impacts such as anticipated sea level rise.

At the College of Nursing clinical experiences take place at both the Clinical Simulation Learning Center (CSLC), our “virtual hospital,” the off-campus setting at acute care hospitals and community-based healthcare agencies. The CSLC is an innovative clinical learning environment for our undergraduate and graduate students to practice providing safe and competent nursing care. In today’s complex healthcare system, it is important for students to have the opportunity to practice clinical skills using the most up to date technologies in an environment that imitates the real life patient care setting. In the BS in Nursing program about half of student clinical experiences take place at the CSLC. In the MS clinical programs and post-BS doctor of nursing practice programs students are also provided with clinical experiences at the CSLC, see On-Campus Clinical for more detailed information about the CSLC and on campus clinical simulation learning experiences. The Office of Academic Clinical Affairs is responsible for ensuring that students meet the health care and clinical site requirements for their clinical experiences. This office is also responsible for securing the appropriate off-campus clinical learning sites and faculty who teach in both on and off-campus clinical. Meeting these health care requirements is critical to your progression through the nursing curriculum.  See Requirements for details on clinical requirements.MS Admissions Policies | NYU College of NursingTABLE OF CONTENTS (click on a topic to jump to a particular section) All applicants must have a baccalaureate degree in nursing or bachelor’s degree in a non-nursing field together with an associate’s degree in nursing.

The four main branches are metaphysics (What is the ultimate nature of reality? What really exists and what is mere appearance?); epistemology (What, if anything, can be known and how?); logic (What are the principles of correct reasoning?); and ethics (What is moral value? And what moral values should we adopt?). Other, more specific, branches of philosophy address questions concerning the nature of art, law, medicine, politics, religion, and the sciences. Everyone tends to have or assume answers to these questions. The aim of the department is to enable students to identify, clarify, and assess these answers, both ancient and modern. Philosophy prepares students for a more reflective life, for advanced studies in the subject, as well as for professions that emphasize analytic thinking and argumentation, such as law, business, and programming.Program of Study | Philosophy | NYUA
major in philosophy requires ten 4-point courses (40 points) in the department.
These ten courses must include the following: All
students should begin with one of the introductory courses. Satisfactory
completion of any one course at the introductory level is a prerequisite for
all of the other courses required for the major, except Logic. It is
recommended that those considering a major also take Logic as soon as possible. No
credit toward the major is awarded for a course with a grade lower than C. This
major, intended as an introduction to cognitive science, is administered by the
Departments of Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology. Ten courses (40 points)
are required (four in linguistics, one in philosophy, four in psychology, and
one additional course). The
linguistics component consists of these four courses (16 points): The
philosophy component is any one of the following three courses (4 points): The
psychology component consists of four courses (16 points): The
tenth course (4 points) will be one of the above-listed courses that has not
already been chosen to satisfy the departmental components. For
advisement, language and mind majors should consult with the directors of
undergraduate studies of the participating departments. A
minor in philosophy requires four 4-point courses (16 points) in the
department. These four courses must include one (and only one) introductory
course (PHIL-UA 1-5), and one course from each of the department's three groups
of courses: No
credit toward the minor is awarded for a course with a grade lower than C. A student may register for an independent study course
(PHIL-UA 301, 302; 2 or 4 points per term) if he or she obtains the consent of
a faculty member who approves the study project and agrees to serve as adviser.
The student must also obtain the approval of either the department chair or the
director of undergraduate studies. The student may take no more than one such
course in any given semester and no more than two such courses in total, unless
granted special permission by either the department chair or the directors of
undergraduate studies. Honors
in philosophy will be awarded to majors who (1) have an overall GPA of 3.65 and
an average in philosophy courses of 3.65 and (2) successfully complete the
honors program. This program consists of the following three 4-point courses
(12 points). (Note: of these courses, only the first two may be counted toward
the ten courses required for the major.) The Junior Honors
Proseminar (PHIL-UA 200) should be taken in the spring semester of junior year.
It introduces students to core readings in some of the main areas of current
philosophy and provides an intensive training in writing philosophy. Admission
to this course usually requires a GPA, both overall and in philosophy courses,
of at least 3.65, as well as the permission of the director of undergraduate
studies. The department will try to make alternative arrangements for students
who wish to participate in the honors program but who will be studying abroad
in spring of their junior year. Next,
the Senior Honors Seminar (PHIL-UA 201) should be taken in the fall semester of
senior year. Students begin to develop their thesis projects, meeting weekly as
a group under the direction of a faculty member to present and discuss their
thesis arguments. Students also select, and begin to meet separately with,
their individual thesis advisers—faculty who work in the areas of students'
thesis projects. Entry to this seminar depends on satisfactory completion of
the Junior Honors Proseminar—or on the special approval of the directors of
undergraduate studies. It also usually requires a GPA of at least 3.65, both
overall and in the philosophy major. Finally, Senior
Honors Research (PHIL-UA 202) should be taken in the spring semester of
senior year. The seminar no longer meets, but each student continues to meet
separately with his or her individual thesis adviser, producing and discussing
a series of rough drafts of the thesis. The final version must be submitted by
a deadline to be determined, in April. It must be approved by the thesis
adviser, as well as by a second faculty reader, for honors to be awarded. The
student must also finish with a GPA of at least 3.65 both overall and in the
major—and here no exceptions will be made. In addition, the thesis advisers
will meet after the decisions by the readers have been made and award some
students highest or high honors, based on thesis quality and other factors
(including GPA in philosophy courses).NYU Computer Science Department > Graduate Programs in Computer ScienceThe Department of           Computer Science offers courses leading to the MS and           PhD degrees.

A. An MS student must complete 36 points of approved coursework with a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0. - 21 credits must be taken as standard CS  classroom-based courses. - An additional 6 credits must be  either standard classroom-based CS courses;  standard classroom courses in the Math Department; independent study with a full-time faculty supervisor in the Computer Science Department, excluding external internships; or master's thesis. Independent study and master's thesis require DGS approval. - The remaining 9 credits may be any of the above, or may be: credits transferred from previous graduate study in Computer Science at another university; external internship; or relevant graduate courses in other departments at NYU. At most 6 credits of external internship may be taken. Relevant graduate courses and external internship require DGS approval. B. An MS student must complete the three foundational courses, which are G22.1170 Fundamental Algorithms; G22.2110 Programming Languages and G22.2250 Operating Systems, and achieve a B- (2.7) or better rolling GPA in the foundational courses attempted. An MS student will remain in good standing only if he or she achieves a B- (2.7) or better rolling GPA in the foundational courses that have been attempted so far. The rolling GPA is the average GPA of the foundational courses taken so far. If a student does not satisfy this requirement, the student will be placed on probation. The student will have until the end of the following semester to restore himself or herself to good standing or will be terminated from the program. A full-time MSCS student must successfully complete at least one of the three foundational courses within the first three courses taken and must successfully complete all three foundational courses within the first six courses taken. A part-time MSCS student must successfully complete a foundational course as the first course taken and must successfully complete all three foundational courses within the first six courses taken. On rare occasion, an entering MSCS student may be granted an exemption from one or more foundational courses. To obtain such an exemption, a student must meet with the Director of Graduate Studies for the MS programs (DGS) at the beginning of the student's first semester at NYU.  The student requesting an exemption must provide clear documentation showing that his or her previous coursework is the equivalent of the corresponding foundational course and, upon approval of the DGS, must pass a placement test at the start of the first semester. The placement test will be as challenging as the final exam in the corresponding course. C.An MS student must pass one course in two of the following four designated application areas: computation for science and society; graphics; intelligent systems; and databases. Computation for science and society includes courses on numerical  methods and courses on applications of computation to the physical,  biological, and social sciences. Graphics includes courses on computer graphics, visualization, solid  modelling, vision, multimedia, and animation. Intelligent systems includes any course on artificial intelligence,  machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing. Database courses include databases, distributed computing, and data  mining. Some courses can be counted in either of two areas. For example a  student taking Computer Vision can count it either as an AI course or as  a Graphics course (but not both). D. An MS student must complete a designated capstone course with a grade of B (3.0) or better. Alternatively, subject to the requirements below and prior approval of the DGS, the student may complete a master's thesis or advanced lab. Capstone courses will be identified each semester by the DGS. They require substantial programming effort and draw on key technical areas covered by the MS program. Examples of capstone courses include Advanced Computer Graphics, Advanced Database Systems, and Compiler Construction. A capstone course should be taken during the last year of studies. A student may instead choose to write a master's thesis if the following conditions are satisfied: the student has a cumulative GPA of 3.75 after six courses; the student has completed all three foundational courses with at least a B+ in each; the student has found a full-time faculty member to serve as a thesis advisor; and the student has received approval from the DGS. MS thesis work can count for up to six credits of master's coursework. The thesis must satisfy the following criteria: it must be original research or design/implementation; the work required must be equivalent to that of two regular MS courses; the thesis must result in a high-quality document of 30-50 pages or more; and the thesis must be read and approved by two full-time faculty members, one of whom is the advisor. At the discretion of the advisor and the DGS, the thesis may be published on the department web page.NYU Computer Science Department > Master of Science in Information SystemsA Master's Degree Combining Computer Science at Courant and Business at Stern. Given today's ubiquitous computing, organizations have a critical need for people who understand, in depth, both computers and business. The most successful technology leaders, from Bill Gates to Andy Grove to Steve Case, are those with deep expertise in technology and business strategy. Successful new technology products and information systems always combine technical quality and smart business strategy. Developing these systems requires extensive communications among technical developers, business managers and users. The Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) program focuses on training students in the core concepts of computing and business so graduates can develop successful careers in management positions that require deep technical skills. For example, MSIS graduates have excelled in the following careers. MSIS students draw from the same courses as Courant Computer Science graduate students and Stern MBA students. The MSIS program offers the academic equivalent of an abbreviated combined Computer Science Master's and MBA degree. The MSIS degree requires 13 courses (39 credits), 5 Stern courses, 5 Computer Science (CS) courses, an Information Technology Projects course and 2 free electives which may be taken at CS or Stern. The Graduate School of Arts & Science requires that students maintain good standing throughout their studies. This involves sustaining a grade-point average of at least 3.0 (B) each semester, successfully completing at least 66% (2/3) of all courses attempted, and completing the degree within five years. Students falling below the GPA and course completion requirements are placed on probation, and given until the following fall or spring semester to return to good standing, or faced with possible academic dismissal from the program. The following course distribution is required (3 credits per course unless otherwise noted): A total of 13 courses (39 credits) are required. One of the last courses an MSIS student takes is IT Projects . This course is a unique software engineering and project management practicum. IT Projects offer students real world experience understanding and solving IT solutions to business problems via participation in a set of team projects at clients such as local corporations, non-profits and government agencies. Each team of about 4 students undertakes one IT project that lasts a semester. The course offers an opportunity to experience (most of) the complete IT project life cycle. The following steps of an IT project are taught and practiced: The course encourages students to learn to balance 'analysis' and 'implementation' efforts to produce good software efficiently. It teaches students about the wide range of project management methodologies and approaches so they can think about how to choose the correct approach. In some cases, the Projects course has led to students obtaining employment with the clients served by the course. Note: please refer to the full set of instructions and guidelines listed on the Computer Science Department Graduate Admissions page. Candidates apply to the MSIS program through the Computer Science department in the Graduate School of Arts and Science. Applicants must have an undergraduate degree. When completing the GSAS application form, under "Proposed Education Program," mark the department as "Computer Science" (code CSCI), and the proposed field of study as "M.S. in I.S." (code MSIS). An application must contain: All documents not in English must be accompanied by original certified English translations. Applications are reviewed by the Computer Science department. Typical admission standards follow, although exceptions sometimes arise. Candidates who meet all standards except CS skills may obtain their CS skills in the Preparatory Accelerated Course (PAC), a one-year program consisting of two courses offered in the evening. PAC is intended for holders of a bachelor's degree in a field other than computer science. PAC teaches programming, data structures, and a couple of programming languages. Students who need PAC must earn a B or better in PAC to remain in the MSIS program. PAC credits do not count towards the MSIS degree. MSIS applications are due on the following deadlines: See here NYU does not provide financial aid to MSIS students.PhD Admissions Policies | NYU College of NursingTABLE OF CONTENTS (click on a topic to jump to a particular section) The purpose of the PhD program is to prepare students to be able to develop and advance scientific knowledge and to serve in educational and research roles in academia.

Shasha Bud Mishra Mehryar Mohri Computational Biology uses mathematical, statistical and algorithmic techniques to solve problems arising in biological research. The faculty working in this area collaborate with biologists and applied mathematicians on a broad range of problems in genomics, proteomics, molecular modeling, systems biology. The CS Department, along with a number of other departments and schools (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, Neuroscience, Sackler Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine) participates in the interdisciplinary Computational Biology Program. Richard Bonenau 's lab develops and implements methods for modeling biological global regulatory circuits that are general and can be applied to many systems. He is one of the leaders in the development and deployment of "Rosetta", a state of the art protein folding program. The primary current research directions include distilling functional information from genome-wide de novo predictions, grouping genes into functionally related and co-regulated clusters, and learning the structure of biological circuits from data. Tamar Schlick 's group works on determining the structural and dynamical properties of macromolecules by computer simulation. Computational techniques are critically needed to link the static structural information on proteins and nucleic acids obtained by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance with the wide range of biological activity and reactivity in the realistic environment of the cell. In this goal, sophisticated models, reliable numerical tools and simulation protocols are critical; the group's research includes all of these aspects of computational molecular modeling. Dennis Shasha 's research interests are focused on three areas: algorithmic and visualization support for computational biology, time series analysis, and tree and graph pattern matching. In computational biology, Dennis Shasha works on tools and algorithms for plant genomics and proteomics research. Time series analysis is needed in many areas ranging from physics to finance to music. Dennis Shasha and collaborators are working on efficient algorithms for performing online windowed correlation analysis on very large time series datasets (thousands or even millions of numbers). Graph pattern matching problems also arise in many areas from XML querying to chemistry; Denis Shasha's group developed a number of algorithms and software tools for various graph matching problems. Dennis Shasha also works on several themes in databases: privacy-protection (when the server cannot be trusted as in out-sourcing cases), database tuning, and testing. Bud Mishra has worked in many areas of Computer Science. His current focus is on applications of computer science and mathematical ideas to biological sciences. He has developed optical mapping technology, a successful approach to physical genome mapping. He aims to develop efficient practical algorithmic tools for genome mapping and sequencing. He leads a number of projects in bioinformatics, primarily in genomics and systems biology, including a novel technology aimed at making fast and cheap sequencing of the human genome broadly accessible, a cancer genome atlas, algebraic model checking for systems biology, large-scale models of pandemic flu and smallpox and many others. Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing.

ProgramsThe departments of mathematics and computer science at NYU's
          Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences offer a master's
          degree in scientific computing. The program provides broad yet
          rigorous training in areas of mathematics and computer science
          related to scientific computing. It aims to prepare people
          with the right talents and background for a technical career
          doing practical computing. The program accommodates both full-time and part-time
          students, with most courses meeting in the evening. The
          program is self-contained and terminal, providing a complete
          set of skills in a field where the need is greater than the
          supply. The masters program focuses on computational science,
          which includes modeling and numerical simulation as used in
          engineering design, development, and optimization. During the academic years of 2012 and 2013 a concentration in
          data sciences existed within the scientific computing program;
          this concentration has been discontinued as of 2014. Incoming
          students interested in data sciences should consider the
          recently-created Masters







            of Science in Data Science within the NYU Center for Data
            Science . Starting Fall of 2014 the modified the program requirements
          and guidelines listed below will apply to all incoming
          students. The new list of required/approved courses includes
          the previous list but gives additional flexibility for
          students to tailor the list of courses to their background and
          interests. Students presently enrolled in the Modeling and
          Simulation track can choose to complete the program either
          under the new or the old requirements. Students enrolled in
          the Data Science concentration should consult the expanded
          course options and modified requirements below since this
          increases flexibility while maintaining consistency with the
          previous requirements. These students should contact Professor Esteban Tabak for help
          in deciding on classes to take. Scientific computing is an indispensable part of almost all
          scientific investigation and technological development at
          universities, government laboratories, and within the private
          sector. Typically a scientific computing team consists of
          several people trained in some branch of mathematics, science,
          statistics, or engineering. What is often lacking is expertise
          in modern computing tools such as visualization, modern
          programming paradigms, and high performance computing. The
          master's program in scientific computing aims to satisfy these
          needs, without omitting basic training in numerical analysis
          and computer science. Many graduates of this program work at
          technologically advanced institutions, especially in research
          and development, where their skills and experience complement
          those without interdisciplinary degrees. The program is also
          open to students who will go on to pursue doctoral studies in
          computer science, mathematics, or statistics. The master's program in scientific computing focuses on the
          mathematics and computer science related to advanced computer
          modeling and simulation. The program is similar in structure
          to terminal master's programs in engineering, combining
          classroom training with practical experience. The coursework
          ranges from foundational mathematics and fundamental
          algorithms to such practical topics as data visualization and
          software tools. Electives encourage the exploration of
          specific application areas such as mathematical and
          statistical finance, applications of machine learning, fluid
          mechanics, finite element methods, and biomedical modeling.
          The program culminates in a master's project, which serves to
          integrate the classroom material. The program requires least three semesters of Calculus
          (including multivariate calculus), as well as linear algebra.
          Experience with programming in a high-level language (e.g.,
          Java, C, C++, Fortran. Python) as well as data structures,
          equivalent to a first-year sequence in computer science, 
          is also required. It is highly desirable that applicants have
          undergraduate major or significant experience in mathematics,
          a quantitative science or engineering, or economics. The deadline for application to the program is March 15th for
          the fall semester. The program admits students both on a
          full-time and on a part-time basis. The application process
          takes place online via the Graduate School of Arts and
          Sciences; please visit the Graduate
            School Admissions site . For more information, please contact us at e-Mail: admissions@math.nyu.edu e-Mail: arnon@cims.nyu.edu web page: http://www.math.nyu.edu A candidate for a master's degree in scientific computing
          must accrue the following: The following are the two required core courses in mathematics: The following are the two required core courses in computer science: The following are the three required core courses in computer science for the concentration in data science: The master's program culminates in a capstone project. The
          capstone project course is usually taken during the final year
          of study. During the project, students go through the entire
          process of solving a real-world problem, from collecting and
          processing data to designing and fully implementing a
          solution. The problems and data sets come from settings
          identical to those encountered in industry, academia, or
          government. The following is a list of courses approved to meet the
          capstone requirement: Advanced students can obtain permission from the director of
          the program to do an individual capstone project under the
          supervision of a faculty member. The Courant Institute makes available for graduate training
          and coursework a network of workstations maintained by systems
          administrators. All graduate students have computer accounts
          for the duration of their studies. NYU also runs a
          high-performance computing center with both shared-memory and
          distributed-memory computers. Many members of the departments of mathematics and computer
          science have research interests bearing on scientific

Cryptography researchers work on theoretical foundations and practical algorithms for a variety of communication tasks, including authentication (proving one's identity), confidentiality of messages, data integrity and other. With rapidly spreading use of the internet for many critical tasks, from financial transactions to medicine, reliable cryptographic techniques are increasingly essential for communication. Yevgeniy Dodis is primarily interested in cryptography. His current primary research directions are cryptography based on imperfect randomness, exposure-resilient cryptography, cryptography with biometrics and other noisy data, hash functions and random oracle model and information-theoretic cryptography. Recent achievements include design of special purpose randomness extractors for imperfect sources, formal model of cryptography based on noisy data, design and formalization of intrusion-resilient cryptosystems and new criteria and techniques for design of hash functions. Victor Shoup 's research areas are cryptography and computational number theory; he is especially interested in the interactions between these two areas. He designs and analyzes cryptographic primitives and protocols with security properties that can be proven based on clear and reasonable assumptions, and which are nevertheless practical enough to use in the real world. Most recently, he has been working on practical secure deniable protocols (i.e., participants in an exchange using this protocol can deny that it ever took place) based on novel and use of number-theoretic algorithms.

They support and empower scholarship and research innovation.   NYU Libraries is an 11-library, 5.9 million-volume system that continually enhances its on-site and online services and resources for students and faculty and expands its research collections in all formats, from paper to electronic and multimedia. NYU Libraries provides students and faculty with access to the world’s scholarship; its resources and services are central to the University community’s intellectual life. The system flagship is the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, which houses more than 4 million volumes, 235,000 serial titles, and over 40,000 linear feet of archives and provides access to thousands of electronic resources both on-site and to the global NYU community via the Internet. The Library receives 10,000 visits per day and circulates 304,000 items annually. Within Bobst are two special collections: Fales Library, specializing in literature, food studies, and New York City avant-garde culture; and the Tamiment Library, internationally known and uniquely strong in the history of left politics, labor, and social protest movements. Bobst Library also contains the Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media; specialized studios to assist with digital projects and data collection/statistical computing; the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation and Conservation Department for the care of paper, audio, and visual material; and over 2,500 seats for study and computing.

Siegel Joel H. Spencer Chee K. Yap Three key issues for an algorithm are: Is it correct? How efficient is it? Can one do better? Our strong and diverse group seeks provable answers to these questions. It focuses on problems and questions in the following areas: computational geometry, computational algebra, randomness (in algorithm design and average case analysis), computational biology, correctness of programs and hardware, and game theory. Richard Cole has worked on a wide range of algorithmic topics. His current focus is the new area of algorithmic economics. One of the fundamental notions in economics is the concept of equilibrium: for example, prices that approximately balance supply and demand are expected to be the norm. From a computer science perspective, for an equilibrium to be attainable, it has to be computationally feasible to find equilibrium prices and, in addition, the market itself must be able to "compute" such prices. Prof. Cole, his collaborators, and students are studying the computational hardness of the pricing problem and specific pricing algorithms for different market and agent models. Yevgeniy Dodis is primarily interested in cryptography. His current primary research directions are cryptography based on imperfect randomness, exposure-resilient cryptography, cryptography with biometrics and other noisy data, hash functions and random oracle model and information-theoretic cryptography. Recent achievements include design of special purpose randomness extractors for imperfect sources, formal model of cryptography based on noisy data, design and formalization of intrusion-resilient cryptosystems and new criteria and techniques for design of hash functions. Subhash Khot is broadly interested in all aspects of algorithms and computational complexity. His specific interests include efficiently computing approximate solutions to NP-hard problems and negative results showing that for many problems, even computing approximate solutions is intractable. His recent works include negative results for semi-definite programming based algorithms, their connection to metric geometry and analysis, and negative results for some learning theory problems. Bud Mishra has worked in many areas of Computer Science. His current focus is on applications of computer science and mathematical ideas to biological sciences. He has developed optical mapping technology, a successful approach to physical genome mapping. He aims to develop efficient practical algorithmic tools for genome mapping and sequencing. He leads a number of projects in bioinformatics, primarily in genomics and systems biology, including a novel technology aimed at making fast and cheap sequencing of the human genome broadly accessible, a cancer genome atlas, algebraic model checking for systems biology, large-scale models of pandemic flu and smallpox and many others. Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing. Oded Regev's research is in mathematical aspects of theoretical computer science.  He is particularly interested in advancing the area of lattice-based cryptography using concepts from quantum computation, analysis, and number theory. Victor Shoup 's research areas are cryptography and computational number theory; he is especially interested in the interactions between these two areas. He designs and analyzes cryptographic primitives and protocols with security properties that can be proven based on clear and reasonable assumptions, and which are nevertheless practical enough to use in the real world. Most recently, he has been working on practical secure deniable protocols (i.e., participants in an exchange using this protocol can deny that it ever took place) based on novel and use of number-theoretic algorithms. Alan Siegel is interested in the analysis of algorithms and related mathematics, which includes applications from probability, statistics, partial and ordinary differential equations and methods in asymptotic analysis. He works on analysis of probabilistic processes and geometric arrangements of lines. His current research focuses on hashing functions and their properties. He is also interested in K-12 mathematics education and new approaches to teaching algorithms at the college and graduate level. Joel Spencer is interested in applications of probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. He worked on many topics including Ramsey theory (which studies the conditions under which order must appear in random systems), discrepancy theory (which deals with measuring irregularities of discrete distributions), random graphs and their connections to logic and randomized greedy methods. He is the author of a number of widely known books on probabilistic method. Chee Yap works in the areas of computational geometry, algebraic computation and visualization. His current research focuses on two themes: exact arithmetic computation and large-scale visualization. Numerical nonrobustness has been called "computer scientists' dirty secret" --everyone knows that our numerical software can break, but we rarely talk about it. The most successful approach to solving the robustness problem in geometry is based on exact geometric computation. Chee Yap and his group are developing techniques for this type of computation based on algebraic zero bounds. Exact geometric computation provides considerable insight into the theory of real computation. The other direction of Chee Yap's work is large-scale visualization, dynamic visualization of geospatial data in particular.

The area of Computer Vision is concerned with algorithms and theory necessary to extract information from visual data (images, video, range scans, stereo images, 3D MRI and CAT scan data etc). There is a growing overlap between computer vision and vision research, as the data acquired from images and video is increasingly used in computer graphics applications. Rob Fergus works in computer vision, machine learning and computer graphics. His goal is to build statistical models of images both at the high level of objects and scenes as well as at the low level of pixels and edges. Such models may then be used for a variety of applications including object recognition, image search and computational photography. Davi Geiger works in computer vision and on related problems in cognitive science. His current research includes understanding stereo vision, human tracking, shape analysis, and memory structure of vision objects. Much of recent is based on applying Bayesian belief propagation networks (graphical models). Yann LeCun 's research interests include the fundamental and practical aspects of machine learning. The main goal of his research is to devise methods through which computers can extract knowledge and automatically acquire "skills" from massive datasets or from experience. Application of learning to perception is a central theme of his work: how can we teach machines to detect and recognize everyday objects in images, how to teach robots to navigate and avoid obstacles solely from visual input. LeCun's group works on a number of fundamental techniques (energy-based models, "deep learning", relational graphical models, and others) which are applied solve problems in computer vision, robotics, image and signal processing, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and economics. LeCun's group also works with the Center for Neural Science on computational models of biological learning. Ken Perlin 's research spans computer graphics rendering, modeling and animation, user interface software and hardware, surface reflectance measurement devices, and novel display devices. His recent research projects include a collaboration with the New York Hall of Science on creating large scale collaborative educational interfaces for kids, uses of novel interfaces (camera-tracked LED pointers and the Nintendo WiiMote game interface) for collaboration and instruction, and a kaleidoscope-based reflectance measuring device for rapid acquisition of surface reflection functions. Chee Yap works in the areas of computational geometry, algebraic computation and visualization. His current research focuses on two themes: exact arithmetic computation and large-scale visualization. Numerical nonrobustness has been called "computer scientists' dirty secret" --everyone knows that our numerical software can break, but we rarely talk about it. The most successful approach to solving the robustness problem in geometry is based on exact geometric computation. Chee Yap and his group are developing techniques for this type of computation based on algebraic zero bounds. Exact geometric computation provides considerable insight into the theory of real computation. The other direction of Chee Yap's work is large-scale visualization, dynamic visualization of geospatial data in particular. Denis Zorin 's interests span two areas: geometric modeling, with applications in computer graphics and computer-aided geometric design, and scientific computing and numerical algorithms. In geometric modeling, he works on efficient and accurate discretizations of various types of surface optimization problems, high-order representations for surfaces, including manifold-based and subdivision surfaces and applications to interactive surface and mesh manipulation. In numeral algorithms, he is interested in fast algorithms for solving boundary integral equations, arising from linear PDEs and their applications. Current efforts include a a general fast multipole-based solver for 3D nonhomogeneous PDEs and arbitrary geometries, and on fluid-deformable surface interactions for Stokes fluid.

Designed by The Office of Web CommunicationsNYU Computer Science Department > Formal Methods and VerificationClark Barrett Patrick Cousot Benjamin F. Goldberg Thomas Wies The long-term goal of the formal methods group is to increase the reliability of hardware and software systems by providing tools and techniques for the analysis of these systems. In formal analysis, a mathematical model of a system is developed, which can then be used to prove properties of the system or to discover bugs in the system when the proof fails. The activities and interests of the formal methods group cover a broad spectrum, from the study of mathematical foundations in temporal and first-order logic, to the implementation of verification tools such as TLV and CVC3, to the application of these tools for proving the correctness of embedded systems and compilers. Clark Barrett 's interests encompass both the theory and application of formal techniques. Theoretical interests include propositional and first-order logic, model and proof theory, and automated deduction. Professor Barrett is a pioneer in the emerging field of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), in which efficient propositional reasoning is combined with decision procedures for first-order theories to produce solvers that are both automatic and expressive. The flagship tool developed by the group is the SMT solver CVC3, which is used by researchers around the world. Patrick Cousot is the founder of Abstract Interpretation, a theory of sound approximation of mathematical structures, in particular those involved in the behavior of computer systems. It allows the systematic derivation of sound methods and algorithms for approximating undecidable or highly complex problems in various areas of computer science (semantics, verification and proof, model-checking, static analysis, program transformation and optimization, typing, software steganography, etc.). Its main current application is on the safety and security of complex hardware and software computer systems. Benjamin Goldberg works at the interface between programming languages, compilers, and verification. One of the directions of his work is to develop techniques for insuring correct compilation, that is, automatic methods for verifying that a compiler is producing executable code that is a correct translation of the source code. A related effort is the development of techniques for the automatic synthesis of correct executable code from high level requirements specifications, particularly in the area of embedded systems. Tools developed by the Translation Validation project were successfully applied to validate optimizations by widely used industrial compilers. Thomas Wies research interests are in formal methods, verification, and programming languages. In particular, he is interested in the theory and development of tools that increase software productivity and assist software engineers in building reliable software. This includes tools for automated verification, automated error detection, and automated debugging. A central thrust of Professor Wies' research is the development of abstraction techniques for automated reasoning about complex data and control in modern software artifacts, such as heap-allocated data structures and concurrency. Analysis of Computer Systems GroupNYU Computer Science Department > Machine Learning and Knowledge RepresentationErnest Davis Yann LeCun Mehryar Mohri Foster Provost David Sontag Machine learning is concerned with developing of mathematical foundations and algorithm design needed for computers to learn, that is, to adapt their responses based on information extracted from data. For example, learning algorithms may allow a robot to navigate an unknown environment, improving its performance as it acquires more and more data, or a voice-controlled system to improve its recognition of a person's speech after analysis of a sufficient number of samples. Machine learning techniques draw on many fundamental areas from statistics to theoretical computer science, and are used in a broad variety applications: robotics, speech analysis, finance, computer games, handwriting recognition to name just a few. Ernest Davis studies the problem of representing commonsense knowledge: that is, the problem of taking the basic knowledge about the real world that is common to all humans; expressing it in a form that is systematic enough to be used by a computer program; and providing the program with techniques for effectively using that knowledge. The primary focus of his work is on spatial and physical reasoning (for example, a formalization of commonsense physical reasoning must capture our intuition about qualitative object behavior under gravity). Other directions of work include reasoning about knowledge, belief, plans, and goals, and their interaction with physical reasoning. Development of formal representations of this type has many potential applications in robotics, product and process design and automated training. Yann LeCun 's research interests include the fundamental and practical aspects of machine learning. The main goal of his research is to devise methods through which computers can extract knowledge and automatically acquire "skills" from massive datasets or from experience. Application of learning to perception is a central theme of his work: how can we teach machines to detect and recognize everyday objects in images, how to teach robots to navigate and avoid obstacles solely from visual input. LeCun's group works on a number of fundamental techniques (energy-based models, "deep learning", relational graphical models, and others) which are applied solve problems in computer vision, robotics, image and signal processing, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and economics. LeCun's group also works with the Center for Neural Science on computational models of biological learning. Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing. Foster Provost studies data mining, knowledge systems, and machine learning and their alignment with business problems. He has applied advanced technologies to a variety of business problems, including fraud detection and customer contact management. His research directions include robust modeling in the face of imprecision in the business environment, and profiling/monitoring on-line activity. David Sontag's research interests include theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning and probabilistic inference, with applications to medicine, natural language processing, and information retrieval. In particular, he studies structured prediction, approximate inference in graphical models, unsupervised learning of latent variable models, and computational trade-offs between learning and inference. Computational and Biological Learning Lab ML Research Group Machine Learning SeminarNYU Computer Science Department > Natural Language and Speech ProcessingRalph Grishman Satoshi Sekine Adam Meyers Mehryar Mohri Naomi Sager The amount of text which is available in electronic form is growing at an explosive rate. In addition to the web, large quantities of text are being collected for medical, legal, commercial, and scientific applications. But the tools for getting the information we need out of this text are still quite primitive. Our research groups in natural language processing are building systems to to extract specific information from large text collections, and to present it in the user's preferred language. A closely related area, speech processing, deals with coding, synthesis and extraction of information from speech signals. Natural language processing has a long history at NYU. The Linguistic String Project was one of the pioneers in natural language processing research in the United States. The Proteus Project focuses on automatically learning the linguistic knowledge needed for information extraction and machine translation. It has developed extraction systems in English and Japanese, and a series of language-independent translation models. It also conducts a wide range of basic research, and develops large-scale dictionaries and other resources for natural language processing. Ralph Grishman 's area of research is natural language processing, -- automatically 'understanding' natural language. He works on systems for information extraction, which can pull out, from text, information about specific relationships or types of events. For example, one of the systems developed by the group can process the newspaper text and construct a table of new executive hires and fires, or corporate acquisitions. A current focus of Ralph Grishman's group is learning information from large text collections. The group is a part of a major DARPA-funded effort to develop an integrated speech-machine translation-information extraction software lead by SRI international. Satoshi Sekine is working on a variety of topics in natural language processing: on-demand information extraction, knowledge discovery from text corpora, to discover patterns, paraphrases, relations and semantic knowledge question answering and summarization, software for Japanese and English text analysis, Japanese and English named entity tagging. Adam Meyers research interests are in natural language processing and computational linguistics. His main direction of work include computational lexicography, predicate argument structure, sentence alignment, coreference and corpus annotation. Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing. Proteus ProjectNYU Computer Science Department > Networks, Operating and Distributed SystemsRobert Grimm Zvi M. Kedem Jinyang Li Dennis E. Shasha Lakshminarayanan Subramanian Michael Walfish Systems and networking research explores how to structure the basic software running on individual computers and how to coordinate between different computers. Significant challenges include how to support increasing numbers of processors in modern computer systems, leverage the many embedded and mobile computing devices, and build services that scale to a global audience. Robert Grimm is interested in the interaction of programming languages and systems. The focus of his research is on exploring how to leverage programming language technologies for making operating and distributed systems easier to build, extend, and administer. Current efforts include Na Kika, a platform for securely extending web applications and scaling them to a global audience through edge-side hosting, and xtc, a toolkit for making programming languages and their compilers easily extensible. He is using the xtc toolkit to realize the Jeannie language, which combines all of Java and all of C into a new language that eliminates verbose boiler-plate code, enables static error detection across the language boundary, and simplifies dynamic resource management. Zvi Kedem has conducted research in computational complexity (algebraic complexity, VLSI complexity); computer graphics (surface reconstruction, BSP tree algorithm); database, knowledge-based systems, and data mining (concurrency control, relational discrete event systems, pincer-search algorithm); parallel and distributed systems (parallel algorithms, compilation for special-purpose parallel machines, reliable parallel computations on LANs and the WWW). His research focus is algorithmic techniques for designing computer-based systems. Jinyang Li 's research interests are in distributed systems and computer networks, and information retrieval systems. Large-scale distributed systems increasingly rely on grassroot deployments, as demonstrated by the popular peer-to-peer file sharing applications and community wireless mesh networks. It is difficult to ensure robustness and security in such distributed systems since the hundreds of nodes comprising these systems are typically unreliable, selfish and potentially malicious. One of the goals of Jinyang's research is to design and build reliable and secure peer-to-peer systems and wireless networks. Dennis Shasha 's research interests are focused on three areas: algorithmic and visualization support for computational biology, time series analysis, and tree and graph pattern matching. In computational biology, Dennis Shasha works on tools and algorithms for plant genomics and proteomics research. Time series analysis is needed in many areas ranging from physics to finance to music. Dennis Shasha and collaborators are working on efficient algorithms for performing online windowed correlation analysis on very large time series datasets (thousands or even millions of numbers). Graph pattern matching problems also arise in many areas from XML querying to chemistry; Denis Shasha's group developed a number of algorithms and software tools for various graph matching problems. Dennis Shasha also works on several themes in databases: privacy-protection (when the server cannot be trusted as in out-sourcing cases), database tuning, and testing. Lakshminarayanan Subramanian 's research interests span the areas of networking, distributed systems, security and technologies for developing countries. He is exploring a range of topics including routing protocol design, security issues in routing protocols, quality of service, congestion control, overlay networks and wireless networks. His current focus is on practical security problems in network protocols and distributed systems (enterprise security and byzantine fault tolerant systems) and systems/networking challenges in developing country settings (issues of low cost connectivity solutions for rural villages and how to make distributed systems operate in environments with intermittent power). He is one of the designers of WiLDNet, a lo-cost network deployed in parts of the world from Ghana to Philippines. Michael Walfish 's research interests are in systems, security, and networking. He has worked on untrusted computation, untrusted storage, failure detection in distributed systems, naming, network architecture, verifiable auctions, and denial-of-service defense. Networks and Wide-Area Systems Group eXTensible C Na KikaNYU Computer Science Department > Scientific ComputingMarsha J. Berger Leslie Greengard Michael L. Overton Olof B. Widlund Margaret H. Wright Denis Zorin Scientific Computing has a long tradition at the Courant Institute, which was founded by Richard Courant at the dawn of the computer era. Computers were invented in the late 1940's and early 1950's for exactly one purpose: solving hard scientific and engineering problems which required too much numerical computation to do by hand. Now, virtually all branches of science and engineering rely heavily on computing. The traditional two branches of science are theoretical science and experimental science. Computational science is now often mentioned as a third branch of science, complementing theory and experiment. Many faculty at Courant, both in the Computer Science and Mathematics Departments, have strong interests in Scientific Computing, both in specific application areas and in general techniques and analysis that have broad applicability. Marsha Berger 's areas of research include computational fluid dynamics, adaptive methods for the numerical solution of pdes in complex geometries, and large-scale parallel computing. She developed techniques for automatic grid for complex geometries generation, needed, for example, to compute the flow around a full aircraft in three dimensions. Efficient simulation of complex flows require adaptive algorithms which concentrate the computational effort where it is most needed. Marsha Berger collaborates with NASA scientists; their jointly developed software is widely used for modeling of aerodynamic behavior in aviation and space launch vehicle projects. Leslie Greengard 's research is largely concerned with the development of fast and adaptive algorithms for computational problems in biology, chemistry, materials science, medicine, and physics. He is best-known for having developed the fast multipole method (FMM) with V. Rokhlin; the FMM is widely used in electromagnetics, astrophysics, molecular simulations, and fluid dynamics. He currently works on protein design, the analysis of "metamaterials", diffusion in complex geometry, and reconstruction methods for magnetic resonance imaging. Michael Overton studies numerical algorithms in optimization and linear algebra. One of the primary directions of his work is semidefinite programming, which is linear programming in the space of real symmetric matrices with eigenvalue positivity constraints. Most recently, his research has focused on optimization problems involving eigenvalues and pseudospectra of nonsymmetric matrices, which arise in control applications. Olof Widlund is interested in numerical algorithms for partial differential equations. He has worked extensively in domain decomposition algorithms for the large linear systems of algebraic equations that arise in many computational continuum mechanics problems, for example in fluid dynamics and elasticity. These algorithms are widely used for solving large-scale problems on parallel and distributed computers. Most recently, Olof Widlund's group has focused its work on FETI-DP and BDDC algorithms for elliptic systems, and on domain decomposition methods for electro-magnetics and mortar finite element methods. Margaret Wright's work includes two parts: basic research into theory and algorithms in optimization and linear algebra; and solution of real-world optimization problems in science and engineering. In her work, the interplay between research and practice goes in both directions. Solving practical problems effectively demands application of her technical knowledge and skills; and the experience of working on a practical problem often inspires fundamental research that moves in new and unexpected directions. Denis Zorin 's interests span two areas: geometric modeling, with applications in computer graphics and computer-aided geometric design, and scientific computing and numerical algorithms. In geometric modeling, he works on efficient and accurate discretizations of various types of surface optimization problems, high-order representations for surfaces, including manifold-based and subdivision surfaces and applications to interactive surface and mesh manipulation. In numeral algorithms, he is interested in fast algorithms for solving boundary integral equations, arising from linear PDEs and their applications. Current efforts include a a general fast multipole-based solver for 3D nonhomogeneous PDEs and arbitrary geometries, and on fluid-deformable surface interactions for Stokes fluid.

NYU's institution code for the GRE and TOEFL is 2596. A special department code is not needed for the GRE. If you are required to take the TOEFL, you must list a department code. The code for Computer Science is 78, or you can use code 99. Do not use code 00 or leave this field blank. To expedite the processing of your application, you should upload the unofficial copies of your results on these tests as part of your online application. However, GSAS must receive the official scores from ETS before the admissions deadline. Evaluation of applications to the PhD program All of the items listed below must be included in your online application.  Please note that the general GRE test is required; the GRE Computer Science subject test is optional. * A completed application form, including a statement of purpose; * Three letters of recommendation; * GRE scores; * Curriculum vitae; * Academic transcripts; * TOEFL scores for any student whose native language or medium of undergraduate instruction is not English. Admission decisions are made by a faculty committee.  The most important factor in an PhD admission decision involves the applicant's likely ability to succeed in original research. Hence the committee pays significant attention to the applicant's statement of purpose and to letters of recommendation that highlight the applicant's contributions to research.  Links to research publications written or co-authored by the applicant are helpful.  (Copies of publications should NOT be submitted.) There are no explicit requirements for grades or GRE scores.  All applicants to the PhD program are expected to have outstanding grades and excellent GRE scores, as well as a demonstrated command of written English.  The letters of recommendation should provide confirmation of the applicant's originality and creativity in research. Financial support of PhD students All full-time Computer Science PhD students in good standing receive financial support, including a nine-month stipend during the academic year, payment of tuition and fees, and health insurance. For some students, this support is provided through the GSAS MacCracken Fellowship program.  Information about the MacCracken program can be found by clicking the link to ``Guidelines'' at http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.financialaid.gradfellowships More than half of Computer Science PhD students receive support from research assistantships associated with external grants received by their research advisors. There are also opportunities for MacCracken fellows to receive additional compensation separate from their MacCracken award by serving as instructional assistants. Prospective PhD students are strongly encouraged to apply for external fellowships. In addition to the prestige associated with external support, the department's policy is to pay the student, whenever possible, a "supplement" that produces a 9-month stipend (during September-May) that is 25% higher than the standard departmental 9-month stipend.
