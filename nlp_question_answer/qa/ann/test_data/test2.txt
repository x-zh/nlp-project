There was a 45% rise in undergraduate applications from 2002 to 2012 from 29,581 to 42,807


Average SAT scores rose from 1300 to 1340


The number of students who achieved 1500 on their SATs nearly doubled in the 2002-2012 period.

The majority of entering freshmen are in the top 10% of their class.

Our undergraduate student body continues to be increasingly diverse. At NYU, the student body has no ethnic majority. In 2002, international students made up 4% of the total, and in 2012, that grew to 12%. The 2013 freshman class is 18% international from a record-breaking 87 countries.

All 50 states are represented in the undergraduate student body.

In 2012, African American and Latino/a students made up 19% of the freshman class, up from 11% in 2002.

In 2013, 17% of the freshman class are first-generation college students.



Institutional aid for undergraduates has increased by almost 138% between 2002 and 2012 (from $78,138,160 to $185,828,888), while aid for all students (undergraduate, graduate and PhD students) increased by 134% between 2002 and 2012.


In 2002, the average aid award for new freshmen was $8,960, which covered 34% of tuition. In 2012, the average aid award for new freshmen was $23,721 and covered 55% of tuition. The difference comes from increases in financial aid and investing financial aid in a way that awards aid to students who need it most.

Pell grants, in dollar terms, increased by 142% between 2002 and 2011 (from $8,648,286 to $20,896,467). Pell is an important metric of economic diversity. The freshman Pell Grant population at Yale is 13%, at Johns Hopkins, 12%, at Princeton, 11%, and at Tufts, 10%. The Pell Grant population among all students at NYU is 22%.






The number of undergraduates studying abroad for a semester or more has almost doubled from 2002 to 2013.


In 2002 we had 5 Global Academic Centers. Today we have 13 NYU locations away from New York, including our degree-granting campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.

65% of classes have less than 20 students. This percentage has been stable for 10 years even with an increasing student body. The number of sections with 50 or more students has declined from 10 to 9 percent.

Over 40 areas of study have been added at the Undergraduate level.

Total disbursements of financial aid increased by 151%, compared with a 105% increase in total revenue from tuition and fees. As a percentage of tuition and fees, financial aid increased from 17% in fiscal 2002 to 22% in fiscal 2013.

Depreciation and amortization increased as a percent of total expenditures from 5% in fiscal 2002 to 9% in fiscal 2013. This reflects the major investments in the University’s physical plant over that time.


NYU received the first public rating on its debt in 2008, and has maintained ratings of "Aa3" and "AA-" by Moody's and S&P, respectively, since that time.


In just the last three years alone, NYU has swiftly risen in the World and US reputational and university rankings as measured by Times Higher Education.
